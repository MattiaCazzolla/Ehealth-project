Preclinical evidence suggests that low-dose ketamine may induce expression of ADNP and that neuroprotective effects of ketamine may be mediated by ADNP. The goal of the proposed research was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and behavioral outcomes of low-dose ketamine in children with ADNP syndrome. We also sought to explore the feasibility of using electrophysiological markers of auditory steady-state response and computerized eye tracking to assess biomarker sensitivity to treatment. This study utilized a single-dose (0.5 mg/kg), open-label design, with ketamine infused intravenously over 40 min. Ten children with ADNP syndrome ages 6 to 12 years were enrolled. Ketamine was generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events. The most common adverse events were elation/silliness (50%), fatigue (40%), and increased aggression (40%). Using parent-report instruments to assess treatment effects, ketamine was associated with nominally significant improvement in a wide array of domains, including social behavior, attention deficit and hyperactivity, restricted and repetitive behaviors, and sensory sensitivities, a week after administration. Results derived from clinician-rated assessments aligned with findings from the parent reports. Overall, nominal improvement was evident based on the Clinical Global Impressions - Improvement scale, in addition to clinician-based scales reflecting key domains of social communication, attention deficit and hyperactivity, restricted and repetitive behaviors, speech, thinking, and learning, activities of daily living, and sensory sensitivities. Results also highlight the potential utility of electrophysiological measurement of auditory steady-state response and eye-tracking to index change with ketamine treatment. Findings are intended to be hypothesis generating and provide preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of ketamine in ADNP syndrome in addition to identifying useful endpoints for a ketamine clinical development program. However, results must be interpreted with caution given limitations of this study, most importantly the small sample size and absence of a placebo-control group.",Journal Article,"Alexander Kolevzon is on the scientific advisory boards of Ovid Therapeutics, Ritrova Therapeutics, and Jaguar Therapeutics and consults to Acadia, Alkermes, GW Pharmaceuticals, Neuren Pharmaceuticals, Clinilabs Drug Development Corporation, and Scioto Biosciences.

This study examined stroke inpatient rehabilitation referral acceptance rates for persons with CI before and after the implementation of a multi-faceted integrated knowledge translation (KT) intervention aimed at improving clinicians' skills in a cognitive-strategy based approach, Cognitive Orientation to daily Occupational Performance (CO-OP), CO-OP KT. METHODS: CO-OP KT was implemented at five inpatient rehabilitation centres, using an interrupted time series design and data from an electronic referral and database system called E-Stroke. CO-OP KT included a 2-day workshop, 4 months of implementation support, health system support, and a sustainability plan. A mixed effects model was used to model monthly acceptance rates for 12 months prior to the intervention and 6 months post. RESULTS: The dataset was comprised of 2604 pre-intervention referrals and 1354 post. In the mixed effects model, those with CI had a lower pre-intervention acceptance rate than those without. Post-intervention the model showed the acceptance rate for those with CI increased by 8.6% (p = 0.02), whereas those with no CI showed a non-significant increase of less than 1%. CONCLUSIONS: Proportionally more persons with CI gained access to inpatient stroke rehabilitation following an integrated KT intervention.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,0.0

Individual differences in reading- and language-related skills are influenced by genetic variation, with twin-based heritability estimates of 30 to 80% depending on the trait. The genetic architecture is complex, heterogeneous, and multifactorial, but investigations of contributions of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were thus far underpowered. We present a multicohort genome-wide association study (GWAS) of five traits assessed individually using psychometric measures (word reading, nonword reading, spelling, phoneme awareness, and nonword repetition) in samples of 13,633 to 33,959 participants aged 5 to 26 y. We identified genome-wide significant association with word reading (rs11208009, P = 1.098 x 10(-8)) at a locus that has not been associated with intelligence or educational attainment. All five reading-/language-related traits showed robust SNP heritability, accounting for 13 to 26% of trait variability. Genomic structural equation modeling revealed a shared genetic factor explaining most of the variation in word/nonword reading, spelling, and phoneme awareness, which only partially overlapped with genetic variation contributing to nonword repetition, intelligence, and educational attainment. A multivariate GWAS of word/nonword reading, spelling, and phoneme awareness maximized power for follow-up investigation. Genetic correlation analysis with neuroimaging traits identified an association with the surface area of the banks of the left superior temporal sulcus, a brain region linked to the processing of spoken and written language. Heritability was enriched for genomic elements regulating gene expression in the fetal brain and in chromosomal regions that are depleted of Neanderthal variants. Together, these results provide avenues for deciphering the biological underpinnings of uniquely human traits.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

To identify the genetic variants underlying general psychopathology in childhood, we performed a genome-wide association study using a total psychiatric problem score. We analyzed 6,844,199 common SNPs in 38,418 school-aged children from 20 population-based cohorts participating in the EAGLE consortium. The SNP heritability of total psychiatric problems was 5.4% (SE = 0.01) and two loci reached genome-wide significance: rs10767094 and rs202005905. We also observed an association of SBF2, a gene associated with neuroticism in previous GWAS, with total psychiatric problems. The genetic effects underlying the total score were shared with common psychiatric disorders only (attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, depression, insomnia) (rG > 0.49), but not with autism or the less common adult disorders (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or eating disorders) (rG < 0.01). Importantly, the total psychiatric problem score also showed at least a moderate genetic correlation with intelligence, educational attainment, wellbeing, smoking, and body fat (rG > 0.29). The results suggest that many common genetic variants are associated with childhood psychiatric symptoms and related phenotypes in general instead of with specific symptoms. Further research is needed to establish causality and pleiotropic mechanisms between related traits.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.,0.26

The current study compared a generic cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) treatment for pediatric anxiety against a modified (social anxiety) treatment that incorporated specific components to target theoretically important maintaining processes. METHOD: A total of 200 children and adolescents (mean age = 9.5 years, SD = 2.2 years; 47% boys) diagnosed with social anxiety disorder as either their principal or additional disorder were randomly allocated to either the generic or the modified treatment. Both treatments were based on a manualized, empirically validated program (Cool Kids) and comprised 10 sessions over 12 weeks. Assessments comprised structured diagnostic interview and parent and youth reports, and covered diagnoses, symptoms, life impairment, and assessment of maintaining processes at post-treatment and 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: The treatments did not differ significantly on the primary outcome (remission of social anxiety disorder) at either post-treatment (remission in generic = 41%; modified = 44%) or follow-up (remission in generic = 51%; modified = 69%), although the latter approached significance (p = .08). They also did not differ at either time point on most secondary measures of outcome. The only maintaining process that changed more under modified treatment was attention to the current task. CONCLUSION: Despite some positive hints in the data, there was little evidence that the modified intervention significantly improved treatment of pediatric social anxiety disorder, despite incorporating strategies to address putative maintaining mechanisms. The similar improvement between treatments on most maintaining processes suggests that new and innovative strategies may be needed to better target these processes.

OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this cross- sectional observational study was to examine the schoolbag weight and to determine the percentage of children were carrying overloaded schoolbag. METHODS: The study group included pupils from five primary public schools in Wroclaw, Poland. Anthropometrical measurements such body weight (BW) and height were conducted on 650 children (51.1% of boys). Children's age, gender, Cole's Index was juxtaposed with schoolbag weight. The mean age of the examined students was 8.7+/-0.8 years (range 7 to 10 years). RESULTS: The mean schoolbags weight was 3.7+/-0.92 kg, which represented 13.0+/-3.8% of pupils' BW. The percentage of pupils carry the schoolbags weighing more than 10% of their BW was 77.9%. More than a quarter of Polish children carry school backpack above 15% of their BW. The majority (96.8%) had schoolbags which may be carried on both shoulders. A significant negative correlation was observed between relative schoolbag weight and Cole's Index (rho = -0.44, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The problem of overloaded schoolbags among elementary school children was frequent. Pupils ought to be educated in the proper packing of their school backpacks.

METHOD: We systematically searched 11 databases. We applied the updated Consensus-based Standards for the selection of health Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) Risk of Bias checklist and criteria for good measurement properties to evaluate instrument development and psychometric properties. Findings were summarized using a COSMIN adaptation of Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations. RESULTS: From 11 databases, 6748 articles were screened. Ninety-one full-length articles were reviewed after removing excluded studies and manual searches conducted by two reviewers. Data were extracted for 12 measures from 20 articles. Of the 12 measures, only three provided sufficient data to evaluate content validity and psychometric measurement properties. The Participation and Sensory Environment Questionnaire-Home (PSEQ-H) was the only measure that satisfied moderate content validity and moderate-to-high quality for measurement properties. These properties included: structural validity, hypothesis testing for construct validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. INTERPRETATION: One measure, the PSEQ-H, met eight criteria for good measurement properties. To facilitate evidence-informed clinical decision-making, all psychometric properties of all 12 sensory-based, proxy-reported measures were presented. The importance of consumer engagement in measure development and the need for ongoing evaluation of measures against contemporaneous standards is recommended.","Journal Article, Review",,0.06

We aimed to quantify the neuroanatomical heterogeneity in structural magnetic resonance imaging measures of cortical surface area (SA), cortical thickness (CT), subcortical volume (SV), and intracranial volume (ICV) in CHR-P individuals compared with healthy controls (HC), and in relation to subsequent transition to a first episode of psychosis. The ENIGMA CHR-P consortium applied a harmonised analysis to neuroimaging data across 29 international sites, including 1579 CHR-P individuals and 1243 HC, offering the largest pooled CHR-P neuroimaging dataset to date. Regional heterogeneity was indexed with the Variability Ratio (VR) and Coefficient of Variation (CV) ratio applied at the group level. Personalised estimates of heterogeneity of SA, CT and SV brain profiles were indexed with the novel Person-Based Similarity Index (PBSI), with two complementary applications. First, to assess the extent of within-diagnosis similarity or divergence of neuroanatomical profiles between individuals. Second, using a normative modelling approach, to assess the 'normativeness' of neuroanatomical profiles in individuals at CHR-P. CHR-P individuals demonstrated no greater regional heterogeneity after applying FDR corrections. However, PBSI scores indicated significantly greater neuroanatomical divergence in global SA, CT and SV profiles in CHR-P individuals compared with HC. Normative PBSI analysis identified 11 CHR-P individuals (0.70%) with marked deviation (>1.5 SD) in SA, 118 (7.47%) in CT and 161 (10.20%) in SV. Psychosis transition was not significantly associated with any measure of heterogeneity. Overall, our examination of neuroanatomical heterogeneity within the CHR-P state indicated greater divergence in neuroanatomical profiles at an individual level, irrespective of psychosis conversion.

Functional studies showed that some variants displayed impaired membrane transport and impaired excitatory synapse-promoting effects. Strikingly, these variations abolished the ability of SLITRK2 wild-type to reduce the levels of the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB in neurons. Moreover, Slitrk2 conditional knockout mice exhibited impaired long-term memory and abnormal gait, recapitulating a subset of clinical features of patients with SLITRK2 variants. Furthermore, impaired excitatory synapse maintenance induced by hippocampal CA1-specific cKO of Slitrk2 caused abnormalities in spatial reference memory.

Objective: To examine the extent to which maternal milk feeding after very preterm birth is associated with cognitive, academic, and behavioral outcomes at school age. Design, Setting, and Participants: This prospective cohort study assessed 586 infants born at less than 33 weeks' gestation at 5 Australian perinatal centers and enrolled in the Docosahexaenoic Acid for Improvement of Neurodevelopmental Outcomes study (January 1, 2001, to December 31, 2005) who were evaluated at a corrected age of 7 years. The statistical analysis was completed on January 19, 2022.

We explored differences in neurometabolite levels and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS)-derived corticomotor representations among children with ADHD and typically developing children. METHODS: We used magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) protocols to measure excitatory (glutamate + glutamine [Glx]) and inhibitory (gamma-aminobutyric acid [GABA]) neurometabolite levels in the dominant primary motor cortex (M1) and the supplementary motor area (SMA) in children with ADHD and typically developing children. We used robotic neuronavigated TMS to measure corticospinal excitability and create corticomotor maps. RESULTS: We collected data from 26 medication-free children with ADHD (aged 7-16 years) and 25 typically developing children (11-16 years). Children with ADHD had lower M1 Glx (p = 0.044, d = 0.6); their mean resting motor threshold was lower (p = 0.029, d = 0.8); their map area was smaller (p = 0.044, d = 0.7); and their hotspot density was higher (p = 0.008, d = 0.9). M1 GABA levels were associated with motor map area (p = 0.036).Limitations: Some TMS data were lost because the threshold of some children exceeded 100% of the machine output. The relatively large MRS voxel required to obtain sufficient signal-to-noise ratio and reliably measure GABA levels encompassed tissue beyond the M1, making this measure less anatomically specific. CONCLUSION: The neurochemistry and neurophysiology of key nodes in the motor network may be altered in children with ADHD, and the differences appear to be related to each other. These findings suggest potentially novel neuropharmacological and neuromodulatory targets for ADHD.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Competing interests: A.

Research in cognitive psychology has found that selective attention favouring the processing of threatening information causally contributes to elevated levels of anxiety; however, this process has not been investigated in the context of T1D. The current study examined whether selective attention for threatening information contributes to the association between anxiety and glycaemic management in adolescents with T1D. Methods: Participants completed a dot-probe task to assess selective attention for diabetes-related threatening information and general non-diabetes-related threatening information and we examined the associations between these measures and measures of HbA1c and anxiety. Results: Findings suggest that individual differences in anxiety vulnerability do not predict HbA1c alongside the attentional bias for threatening information. Conclusions: The attentional bias for threatening information makes a contribution to the relationship between anxiety and glycaemic management and may represent a target for therapeutic intervention to both reduce anxiety and improve glycaemic management.",Journal Article,The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,0.19

METHODS: A population-based, cross-sectional analysis included pediatric patients ages 5-20 years old from the 2016 and 2019 Kids Inpatient Database (unweighted N = 111,702). ICD-10-CM codes were used to identify corticosteroids use, asthma, and ADHD cases. Survey logistic regression models with purposeful variable selection algorithms were built to examine the association between corticosteroids use, and ADHD by asthma severity and age. An inverse probability weighting (IPW) approach was used to help further control residual confounding. RESULTS: Among children aged 5-11 years old, the odds of ADHD were significantly higher in children with moderate to severe asthma who used inhaled corticosteroids than nonusers (moderate asthma: adjusted odds ratios [aOR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.14-2.44; severe asthma: aOR 1.61, 95% CI 1.18-2.21). Although oral corticosteroid use was not independently associated with ADHD in young children, combined use of inhaled and oral corticosteroid had almost 5 times higher odds of use among ADHD in children with severe asthma vs. nonusers (aOR 4.85, 95% CI 2.07 - 11.35). No associations were found between any corticosteroid use and ADHD among asthmatic children aged 12-20 years.

Precision medicine for neurodevelopmental disorders (such as cerebral palsy, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, Tourette syndrome, and autism spectrum disorder) in children has predominantly focused on advances in genomic sequencing technologies to increase our ability to identify single gene mutations, diagnose a multitude of rare neurodevelopmental disorders, and gain insights into pathogenesis. Although targeting specific gene variants with high penetrance will help some children with rare disease, this approach will not help most children with neurodevelopmental disorders. A 'pathway' driven approach targeting the cumulative influence of psychosocial, epigenetic, or cellular factors is likely to be more effective. To optimize the therapeutic potential of precision medicine, we present a biopsychosocial integrated framework to examine the 'gene-environment neuroscience interaction'. Such an approach would be supported through harnessing the power of big data, transdiagnostic assessment, impact and implementation evaluation, and a bench-to-bedside scientific discovery agenda with ongoing clinician and patient engagement. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Precision medicine has predominantly focused on genetic risk factors. The impact of environmental risk factors, particularly inflammatory, metabolic, and psychosocial risks, is understudied.

This retrospective case series reports the use of these drugs in children aged 2 to 13 years. Methodology: A total of 82 children (mean age, 5 years; 79% male) with ASD treated at the Kids Neuro Clinic and Rehab Center in Dubai between January 2020 and September 2021 were included in this retrospective case series. All patients had comorbid challenging behaviors that were resistant to standard supportive therapies alone and warranted pharmacological intervention. The Childhood Autism Rating Scale-2nd Edition Standard form (CARS2-ST) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI)-Severity (CGI-S) and CGI-Improvement (CGI-I) scales were used to assess the severity of ASD at baseline and to monitor response to treatment with risperidone or aripiprazole. Results: Besides the expected improvement in comorbid challenging behaviors, 79/82 patients (96%) attained a CGI-I score of 2 or 1 following treatment, and 35/82 patients (43%) achieved both a CGI-I score of 1 and minimal-to-no symptoms as per the CARS2-ST test, with complete resolution of their ASD signs and symptoms. The differences in the overall mean CARS2-ST and CGI-S scores pre- and post-treatment were statistically significant (Z = -7.86, p &lt; 0.0001 for both), with pre- and post-treatment mean values of 42 and 23 for CARS2-ST, respectively, and 6 and 2 for CGI-S, respectively.

However, knowledge on preschool development of executive functions is limited but greatly needed to guide early intervention. The current study examined emerging executive functions in young children with SCT. Participants were 72 SCT children and 70 population-based controls, aged 3-7 years, who completed a neurocognitive assessment of both global executive function (MEFS) and verbal executive function skills (NEPSY Word Generation). Caregivers completed the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF) questionnaire to capture real-world behavioral manifestations of impairments in executive functions. Results showed that impairments were significantly more prevalent in SCT than in controls and already present from 3 years, specifically verbal executive functions and working memory. Broader more pronounced impairments were found in older children with SCT. Age was significantly related to executive functions, but specific domains showed different relations with age. For example, deficits in planning and organizing remained evident with older age in SCT whereas it declined with age in controls. Impairments in executive functions were present across different levels of intelligence. Already at an early age, impairments across executive functions should be considered part of the neurodevelopmental profile of SCT, which appear more prominent at later age. Future studies should investigate developmental pathways of executive functions in SCT, given its relevance in cognitive, social, and emotional development. Executive functions should be screened and monitored in children with SCT and could be an important target of preventive intervention.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,0.0

Psychological interventions including behavioral and cognitive strategies play a key role in chronic pain management, but there is a paucity of research exploring their use in children with CP. Aim: To investigate the acceptability and feasibility of biofeedback assisted relaxation training (BART) for chronic pain management in children with CP using a mixed-methods study design. Methods: Biofeedback assisted relaxation training was delivered via BrightHearts, an iOS application. Inclusion criteria were as follows: CP; self-reported chronic pain; age 9-18 years; and fluent English speaker. Children used BrightHearts for ten minutes daily, over four weeks. Qualitative post-intervention interviews were undertaken (child, parent) and quantitative pre-post measures (child) were gathered including pain intensity (numerical rating scale), and anxiety intensity (numerical rating scale). Content analysis was conducted for qualitative data. Descriptive statistics and exploratory analyses were performed for quantitative data. Results: Ten children participated (n = 3 male, mean age = 13.1 years SD = 2.5 years, GMFCS level I = 4, II = 2, III = 3, IV = 1). Predominant movement disorder was spasticity (n = 7) and dyskinesia, mainly dystonia (n = 3). Content analysis suggested an overarching theme ""BrightHearts is a good thing to put in my toolbox"" providing an overall representation of participants' experiences. For many, BrightHearts was a valuable supplement to children's pain management strategies: ""The source of the pain is still there, but the actual effect of the pain isn't so relevant."" Four sub-themes were identified: ""Managing my pain;"" ""Managing my anxiety and stress,"" ""Helping me do what I need to do;"" and ""Fitting it into my life."" Some participants reported improvements in their anxiety management, and others described benefits in sleep and school following improved pain/anxiety management. A range of practical and personal factors within this heterogeneous group presented barriers to using BrightHearts including limited time, attention, and boredom. Seven-out-of-eight children would recommend BrightHearts to others with chronic pain and six-out-of-eight noticed a difference in their pain since using BrightHearts (n = 2 missing data). Non-significant reductions in pain or anxiety intensity scores were found following the intervention. Conclusion: This pilot suggests BrightHearts is an acceptable and feasible intervention for chronic pain management in children with CP and may be useful for some children as part of a multimodal approach.",Journal Article,"Authors KO, NS, SP, and AM have no conflicts of interest.

Although associations between externalizing or internalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity have been found in clinical and non-clinical pediatric samples, no previous study has examined whether similar shared associations are present across children with different NDDs. METHODS: Multi-modal neuroimaging and behavioral data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network were used. POND participants aged 6-18 years with a primary diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as typically developing children (TDC) with T1-weighted, resting-state fMRI or diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and parent-report Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL) data available, were analyzed (total n = 346). Associations between externalizing or internalizing behavior and cortico-amygdalar structural and functional connectivity indices were examined using linear regressions, controlling for age, gender, and image-modality specific covariates. Behavior-by-diagnosis interaction effects were also examined. RESULTS: No significant linear associations (or diagnosis-by-behavior interaction effects) were found between CBCL-measured externalizing or internalizing behaviors and any of the connectivity indices examined. Post-hoc bootstrapping analyses indicated stability and reliability of these null results. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides evidence towards an absence of a shared linear relationship between internalizing or externalizing behaviors and cortico-amygdalar connectivity properties across a transdiagnostic sample of children with different primary NDD diagnoses and TDC. Different methodological approaches, including incorporation of multi-dimensional behavioral data (e.g., task-based fMRI) or clustering approaches may be needed to clarify complex brain-behavior relationships relevant to externalizing/internalizing behaviors in heterogeneous clinical NDD populations.",Journal Article,,0.28

While diagnostically independent, they can co-occur in the same individual at both the trait and diagnostic levels. The effect of such co-occurrence is hypothesized to worsen functional impairment. The diametric model, however, suggests that the disorders are etiologically and phenotypically diametrical, representing the extreme of a unidimensional continuum of cognition and behavior. A central prediction of this model is that functional impairment would be attenuated in individuals with mixed symptom expressions or genetic liability to both disorders. We tested this hypothesis in two clinical populations and one healthy population. In individuals with chronic schizophrenia and in individuals with first episode psychosis we evaluated the combined effect of autistic traits and positive psychotic symptoms on psychosocial functioning. In healthy carriers of alleles of copy number variants (CNVs) that confer risk for both autism and schizophrenia, we also evaluated whether variation in psychosocial functioning depended on the combined risk conferred by each CNV. Relative to individuals with biased symptom/CNV risk profiles, results show that functional impairments are attenuated in individuals with relatively equal levels of positive symptoms and autistic traits-and specifically stereotypic behaviors-, and in carriers of CNVs with relatively equal risks for either disorder. However, the pattern of effects along the ""balance axis"" varied across the groups, with this attenuation being generally less pronounced in individuals with high-high symptom/risk profile in the schizophrenia and CNV groups, and relatively similar for low-low and high-high individuals in the first episode psychosis group. Lower levels of functional impairments in individuals with ""balanced"" symptom profile or genetic risks would suggest compensation across mechanisms associated with autism and schizophrenia. CNVs that confer equal risks for both disorders may provide an entry point for investigations into such compensatory mechanisms. The co-assessment of autism and schizophrenia may contribute to personalized prognosis and stratification strategies.",Journal Article,,0.0

Here we assemble an interactive open resource to benchmark brain morphology derived from any current or future sample of MRI data ( http://www.brainchart.io/ ). With the goal of basing these reference charts on the largest and most inclusive dataset available, acknowledging limitations due to known biases of MRI studies relative to the diversity of the global population, we aggregated 123,984 MRI scans, across more than 100 primary studies, from 101,457 human participants between 115 days post-conception to 100 years of age. MRI metrics were quantified by centile scores, relative to non-linear trajectories(2) of brain structural changes, and rates of change, over the lifespan. Brain charts identified previously unreported neurodevelopmental milestones(3), showed high stability of individuals across longitudinal assessments, and demonstrated robustness to technical and methodological differences between primary studies. Centile scores showed increased heritability compared with non-centiled MRI phenotypes, and provided a standardized measure of atypical brain structure that revealed patterns of neuroanatomical variation across neurological and psychiatric disorders. In summary, brain charts are an essential step towards robust quantification of individual variation benchmarked to normative trajectories in multiple, commonly used neuroimaging phenotypes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

METHOD: In 22 cohorts, multiple univariate genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were performed using repeated assessments of internalizing symptoms, in a total of 64,561 children and adolescents between 3 and 18 years of age. Results were aggregated in meta-analyses that accounted for sample overlap, first using all available data, and then using subsets of measurements grouped by rater, age, and instrument. RESULTS: The meta-analysis of overall internalizing symptoms (INToverall) detected no genome-wide significant hits and showed low single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) heritability (1.66%, 95% CI = 0.84-2.48%, neffective = 132,260). Stratified analyses indicated rater-based heterogeneity in genetic effects, with self-reported internalizing symptoms showing the highest heritability (5.63%, 95% CI = 3.08%-8.18%). The contribution of additive genetic effects on internalizing symptoms appeared to be stable over age, with overlapping estimates of SNP heritability from early childhood to adolescence. Genetic correlations were observed with adult anxiety, depression, and the well-being spectrum (|rg| > 0.70), as well as with insomnia, loneliness, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism, and childhood aggression (range |rg| = 0.42-0.60), whereas there were no robust associations with schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or anorexia nervosa. CONCLUSION: Genetic correlations indicate that childhood and adolescent internalizing symptoms share substantial genetic vulnerabilities with adult internalizing disorders and other childhood psychiatric traits, which could partially explain both the persistence of internalizing symptoms over time and the high comorbidity among childhood psychiatric traits. Reducing phenotypic heterogeneity in childhood samples will be key in paving the way to future GWAS success.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.26

Despite accumulating evidence of high rates of diagnostic overlap and shared symptoms between ASD and ADHD, functional connectivity underpinning emotion processing across these two neurodevelopmental disorders, compared to typical developing peers, has rarely been examined. The current study used magnetoencephalography to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity during the presentation of happy and angry faces in 258 children (5-19 years), including ASD, ADHD and typically developing (TD) groups to determine possible differences in emotion processing. Data-driven clustering was also applied to determine whether the patterns of connectivity differed among diagnostic groups. We found reduced functional connectivity in the beta band in ASD compared to TD, and a further reduction in the ADHD group compared to the ASD and the TD groups, across emotions. A group-by-emotion interaction in the gamma frequency band was also observed. Greater connectivity to happy compared to angry faces was found in the ADHD and TD groups, while the opposite pattern was seen in ASD. Data-driven subgrouping identified two distinct subgroups: NDD-dominant and TD-dominant; these subgroups demonstrated emotion- and frequency-specific differences in connectivity. Atypicalities in specific brain networks were strongly correlated with the severity of diagnosis-specific symptoms. Functional connectivity strength in the beta network was negatively correlated with difficulties in attention; in the gamma network, functional connectivity strength to happy faces was positively correlated with adaptive behavioural functioning, but in contrast, negatively correlated to angry faces. Our findings establish atypical frequency- and emotion-specific patterns of functional connectivity between NDD and TD children.

In the following study, we use factor analysis to deconstruct the ASD-ADHD phenotype into its underlying phenotypic domains and test for measurement invariance across adaptive functioning, age, gender and ASD/ADHD clinical diagnoses. METHODS: Participants included children and youth (aged 3-20 years) with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 727) or ADHD (n = 770) for a total of 1,497 participants. Parents of these children completed the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ), a measure of autism symptoms, and the Strengths and Weaknesses of ADHD and Normal Behaviour (SWAN) questionnaire, a measure of ADHD symptoms. An exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was performed on combined SCQ and SWAN items. This was followed by a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and tests of measurement invariance. RESULTS: EFA revealed a four-factor solution (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, social-communication, and restricted, repetitive, behaviours and interests (RRBI)) and a CFA confirmed good model fit. This solution also showed good model fit across subgroups of interest. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that a combined ASD-ADHD phenotype is characterized by two latent ASD domains (social communication and RRBIs) and two latent ADHD domains (inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity). We established measurement invariance of the derived measurement model across adaptive functioning, age, gender and ASD/ADHD diagnoses.",Journal Article,,0.43

The possible impacts of these regional alterations in terms of structural network effects have not previously been characterized. Inter-regional morphological covariance analysis can capture network connectivity between different cortical areas at the macroscale level. Here, we used cortical thickness data from 1455 individuals with ASD and 1560 controls, across 43 independent datasets of the ENIGMA consortium's ASD Working Group, to assess hemispheric asymmetries of intra-individual structural covariance networks, using graph theory-based topological metrics. Compared with typical features of small-world architecture in controls, the ASD sample showed significantly altered average asymmetry of networks involving the fusiform, rostral middle frontal, and medial orbitofrontal cortex, involving higher randomization of the corresponding right-hemispheric networks in ASD. A network involving the superior frontal cortex showed decreased right-hemisphere randomization. Based on comparisons with meta-analyzed functional neuroimaging data, the altered connectivity asymmetry particularly affected networks that subserve executive functions, language-related and sensorimotor processes. These findings provide a network-level characterization of altered left-right brain asymmetry in ASD, based on a large combined sample.

Few prospective studies have explored whether toddler feeding problems predict later psychopathology. METHODS: Mothers of 1,136 children from the Upstate KIDS cohort study provided data when children were 2.5 and 8 years of age. Food refusal (picky eating) and mechanical/distress feeding problems and developmental delays were assessed at 2.5 years. Child eating behaviors (enjoyment of food, food fussiness, and emotional under and overeating) and child psychopathology (attention-deficit/hyperactivity (ADHD), oppositional-defiant (OD), conduct disorder (CD), and anxiety/depression) symptoms were assessed at 8 years. RESULTS: Mechanical/distress feeding problems at age 2.5, but not food refusal problems, were associated with ADHD, problematic behavior (OD/CD), and anxiety/depression symptoms at 8 years in models adjusting for eating behaviors at 8 years and child and family covariates. Associations with mechanical/distress feeding problems were larger for ADHD and problematic behavior than anxiety/depression symptoms, though all were modest. Model estimates were similar for boys and girls. CONCLUSIONS: Much of the research on feeding problems focuses on picky eating. This study suggests that early mechanical and mealtime distress problems may serve as better predictors of later psychopathology than food refusal.

To address this gap, we performed detailed characterisation of autistic behaviours in children with NF1 and investigated their association with other common NF1 child characteristics. METHODS: Participants were drawn from a larger cross-sectional study examining autism in children with NF1. The population analysed in this study scored above threshold on the Social Responsiveness Scale-Second Edition (T-score >/= 60; 51% larger cohort) and completed the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) and/or the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Second Edition (ADOS-2). All participants underwent evaluation of their intellectual function, and behavioural data were collected via parent questionnaires. RESULTS: The study cohort comprised 68 children (3-15 years). Sixty-three per cent met the ADOS-2 'autism spectrum' cut-off, and 34% exceeded the more stringent threshold for 'autistic disorder' on the ADI-R. Social communication symptoms were common and wide-ranging, while restricted and repetitive behaviours (RRBs) were most commonly characterised by 'insistence on sameness' (IS) behaviours such as circumscribed interests and difficulties with minor changes. Autistic behaviours were weakly correlated with hyperactive/impulsive attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms but not with inattentive ADHD or other behavioural characteristics. Language and verbal IQ were weakly related to social communication behaviours but not to RRBs. LIMITATIONS: Lack of genetic validation of NF1, no clinical diagnosis of autism, and a retrospective assessment of autistic behaviours in early childhood. CONCLUSIONS: Findings provide strong support for elevated autistic behaviours in children with NF1. While these behaviours were relatively independent of other NF1 comorbidities, the importance of taking broader child characteristics into consideration when interpreting data from autism-specific measures in this population is highlighted. Social communication deficits appear similar to those observed in idiopathic autism and are coupled with a unique RRB profile comprising prominent IS behaviours. This autistic phenotype and its relationship to common NF1 comorbidities such as anxiety and executive dysfunction will be important to examine in future research. Current findings have important implications for the early identification of autism in NF1 and clinical management.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,0.11

These sensory differences have been shown to promote challenging behaviours and distress in autistic individuals and are predictive of other functions including motor, social, and cognitive abilities. Preliminary research suggests that specific sensory differences may cluster together within individuals creating discrete sensory phenotypes. However, the manner in which these sensory differences cluster, and whether the resulting phenotypes are associated with specific cognitive and social challenges is unclear. METHODS: Short sensory profile data from 599 autistic children and adults between the ages of 1 and 21 years were subjected to a K-means cluster analysis. Analysis of variances compared age, adaptive behaviour, and traits associated with autism, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive and compulsive disorder across the resultant clusters. RESULTS: A five-cluster model was found to minimize error variance and produce five sensory phenotypes: (1) sensory adaptive, (2) generalized sensory differences, (3) taste and smell sensitivity, (4) under-responsive and sensation seeking, and (5) movement difficulties with low energy. Age, adaptive behaviour, and traits associated with autism, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive and compulsive disorder were found to differ significantly across the five phenotypes. LIMITATIONS: The results were based on parent-report measures of sensory processing, adaptive behaviour, traits associated with autism, attention-deficit and hyperactivity disorder, and obsessive and compulsive disorder, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further, not all measures are standardized, or psychometrically validated with an autism population. Autistic individuals with an intellectual disability were underrepresented in this sample. Further, as these data were obtained from established records from a large provincial database, not all measures were completed for all individuals. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that sensory difficulties in autistic individuals can be clustered into sensory phenotypes, and that these phenotypes are associated with behavioural differences. Given the large degree of heterogeneity in sensory difficulties seen in the autistic population, these sensory phenotypes represent an effective way to parse that heterogeneity and create phenotypes that may aid in the development of effective treatments and interventions for sensory difficulties.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.45

This study investigated these relationships using primary caregiver ratings of executive functions, ADHD symptoms and social skills in children with NF1. Participants were 136 children with NF1 and 93 typically developing (TD) controls aged 3-15 years recruited from 3 multidisciplinary neurofibromatosis clinics in Melbourne and Sydney, Australia, and Washington DC, USA. Mediation analysis was performed on primary outcome variables: parent ratings of executive functions (Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function, Metacognition Index), ADHD symptoms (Conners-3/Conners ADHD Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorders Scales) and social skills (Social Skills Improvement System-Rating Scale), adjusting for potential confounders (full scale IQ, sex, and social risk). Results revealed significantly poorer executive functions, elevated ADHD symptoms and reduced social skills in children with NF1 compared to controls. Poorer executive functions significantly predicted elevated ADHD symptoms and poorer social skills. Elevated ADHD symptoms significantly mediated the relationship between executive functions and social skills problems although did not fully account for social dysfunction. This study provides evidence for the importance of targeting ADHD symptoms as part of future interventions aimed at promoting prosocial behaviors in children with NF1.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,0.68

To better understand ToM in ASD and ADHD children, we examined the neural correlates using the SAT and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in a cohort of 200 children: ASD (N = 76), ADHD (N = 74) and typically developing (TD; N = 50) (4-19 years). In the scanner, participants were presented with SAT videos corresponding to social help, social threat, and random conditions.

No trial of an intervention administered to infants before diagnosis has shown an effect on diagnostic outcomes to date. Objective: To determine the efficacy of a preemptive intervention for ASD beginning during the prodromal period. Design, Setting, and Participants: This 2-site, single rater-blinded randomized clinical trial of a preemptive intervention vs usual care was conducted at 2 Australian research centers (Perth, Melbourne). Community sampling was used to recruit 104 infants aged 9 to 14 months showing early behaviors associated with later ASD, as measured by the Social Attention and Communication Surveillance-Revised. Recruitment occurred from June 9, 2016, to March 30, 2018. Final follow-up data were collected on April 15, 2020. Interventions: Infants were randomized on a 1:1 ratio to receive either a preemptive intervention plus usual care or usual care only over a 5-month period. The preemptive intervention group received a 10-session social communication intervention, iBASIS-Video Interaction to Promote Positive Parenting (iBASIS-VIPP). Usual care comprised services delivered by community clinicians. Main Outcomes and Measures: Infants were assessed at baseline (approximate age, 12 months), treatment end point (approximate age, 18 months), age 2 years, and age 3 years. Primary outcome was the combined blinded measure of ASD behavior severity (the Autism Observation Scale for Infants and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, second edition) across the 4 assessment points. Secondary outcomes were an independent blinded clinical ASD diagnosis at age 3 years and measures of child development. Analyses were preregistered and comprised 1-tailed tests with an alpha level of .05. Results: Of 171 infants assessed for eligibility, 104 were randomized; 50 infants (mean [SD] chronological age, 12.40 [1.93] months; 38 boys [76.0%]) received the iBASIS-VIPP preemptive intervention plus usual care (1 infant was excluded after randomization), and 53 infants (mean [SD] age, 12.38 [2.02] months; 32 boys [60.4%]) received usual care only. A total of 89 participants (45 in the iBASIS-VIPP group and 44 in the usual care group) were reassessed at age 3 years. The iBASIS-VIPP intervention led to a reduction in ASD symptom severity (area between curves, -5.53; 95% CI, -infinity to -0.28; P = .04). Reduced odds of ASD classification at age 3 years was found in the iBASIS-VIPP group (3 of 45 participants [6.7%]) vs the usual care group (9 of 44 participants [20.5%]; odds ratio, 0.18; 95% CI, 0-0.68; P = .02). Number needed to treat to reduce ASD classification was 7.2 participants. Improvements in caregiver responsiveness and language outcomes were also observed in the iBASIS-VIPP group. Conclusions and Relevance: Receipt of a preemptive intervention for ASD from age 9 months among a sample of infants showing early signs of ASD led to reduced ASD symptom severity across early childhood and reduced the odds of an ASD diagnosis at age 3 years.

Here, we devised a novel approach to profile the inter-individual variability in functional network organization and tested whether such idiosyncrasy contributes to connectivity alterations in ASD. Studying a multi-centric dataset with 157 ASD and 172 TD, we obtained robust evidence for increased idiosyncrasy in ASD relative to TD in default mode, somatomotor and attention networks, but also reduced idiosyncrasy in lateral temporal cortices. Idiosyncrasy increased with age and significantly correlated with symptom severity in ASD. Furthermore, while patterns of functional idiosyncrasy were not correlated with ASD-related cortical thickness alterations, they co-localized with the expression patterns of ASD risk genes. Notably, we could demonstrate that patterns of atypical idiosyncrasy in ASD closely overlapped with connectivity alterations that are measurable with conventional case-control designs and may, thus, be a principal driver of inconsistency in the autism connectomics literature. These findings support important interactions between inter-individual heterogeneity in autism and functional signatures. Our findings provide novel biomarkers to study atypical brain development and may consolidate prior research findings on the variable nature of connectome level anomalies in autism.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

Four events were measured between 15 and 23 years of age: low educational achievement, a conviction of any crime, substance use disorder, and depression. As predicted, young relative age was a risk factor for ADHD (with an odds ratio of 1.7), which in turn was a risk factor for all 4 outcomes considered (with odds ratios of 3.5-5.2). The novelty of their analyses, however, was to evaluate the additive effects of relative young age beyond ADHD on negative long-term outcomes. For the first time, Kuntsi et al.(7) demonstrated that children with ADHD who are the youngest in their class are at increased risk for lower educational achievement and receiving a diagnosis of substance use disorder when compared to children with ADHD who are the oldest in their class.","Editorial, Comment",,0.34

What they can and cannot do is called their level of functioning. There are lots of assessment measures that aim to assess functioning. But, we are not sure if these measures assess all the things we need to know about these children's functioning. Other research has identified lists of items (codes) that need to be assessed to understand functioning for young children with different neurodevelopmental conditions fully. These lists include body functions (the things a child's body or brain can do), activities and participation (the activities and tasks a child does) and environmental factors (parts of the environment that can influence functioning). In this study, we looked at the items from these lists assessed by different functioning measures to see how they compared to what should be assessed. The measures that we looked at covered 21%-57% of all the codes and 19%-63% of the codes for lists specific to different conditions. Most of the measures focused on activity and participation codes, and they rarely assessed environmental factors. Knowing which codes and how much of the lists the measures assess can help researchers, clinicians and policymakers to choose measures that are more appropriate for young children with neurodevelopmental conditions.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.19

The maternal immune activation hypothesis proposes that inflammatory perturbations in utero can affect fetal neurodevelopment, and evidence from human epidemiological studies supports an association between maternal inflammation during pregnancy and offspring neurodevelopmental disorders (NDDs). Diverse maternal inflammatory factors, including obesity, asthma, autoimmune disease, infection and psychosocial stress, are associated with an increased risk of NDDs in the offspring. In addition to inflammation, epigenetic factors are increasingly recognized to operate at the gene-environment interface during NDD pathogenesis. For example, integrated brain transcriptome and epigenetic analyses of individuals with NDDs demonstrate convergent dysregulated immune pathways. In this Review, we focus on the emerging human evidence for an association between maternal immune activation and childhood NDDs, including autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and Tourette syndrome. We refer to established pathophysiological concepts in animal models, including immune signalling across the placenta, epigenetic 'priming' of offspring microglia and postnatal immune-brain crosstalk. The increasing incidence of NDDs has created an urgent need to mitigate the risk and severity of these conditions through both preventive strategies in pregnancy and novel postnatal therapies targeting disease mechanisms.","Journal Article, Review",,0.06

Significant genetic correlations were observed with most psychiatric and psychological traits (range [Formula: see text]: 0.19-1.00), except for obsessive-compulsive disorder. Aggression had a negative genetic correlation (rg = ~-0.5) with cognitive traits and age at first birth. Aggression was strongly genetically correlated with smoking phenotypes (range [Formula: see text]: 0.46-0.60). The genetic correlations between aggression and psychiatric disorders were weaker for teacher-reported AGG than for mother- and self-reported AGG.

Vision impairments are common after concussion, but it is unknown exactly how eye tracking may be affected after injury and how it is associated with other clinical concussion assessments. PURPOSE: This study aimed to (1) examine the relationship between eye tracking performance (BOX score) and other common concussion evaluations, (2) identify if eye tracking adds novel information that augments baseline concussion evaluations, and (3) examine the effect of age, concussion history, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder on eye tracking and other ophthalmological measures. METHODS: A total of 102 male high school football athletes (age, 16.0 years; 95% confidence interval, 15.8 to 16.2 years) completed a series of visual and neurocognitive tests during their pre-season baseline assessment. The main outcome measures were BOX score, near point of convergence (NPC) distance, binocular accommodative amplitude (BAA) distance, Standardized Assessment of Concussion score, and Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing composite scores. RESULTS: BOX score was not significantly associated with symptoms, Standardized Assessment of Concussion score, NPC distance, BAA distance, or any Immediate Post-Concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing composite scores. Age, concussion history, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and number of prior years playing football were not significantly associated with BOX score or NPC distance, but there was a significant association between concussion history and greater BAA distance (beta = 1.60; 95% confidence interval = 0.19 to 3.01; P < .03). The BOX score cutoff of 10 resulted in a 12% false-positive rate. CONCLUSIONS: Eye tracking was not significantly associated with the commonly used clinical concussion assessments.

An elevated risk for psychopathology has also been described, including attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The present study aimed at identifying early markers of ADHD, providing the first investigation of ADHD symptomology in very young children with SCT. The variety, type, and severity of ADHD symptomology in 1-6-year-old children with SCT (n = 104) were compared with population-based controls (n = 101) using the strengths and weaknesses of ADHD symptoms and normal-behavior (SWAN) parent-report questionnaire. ADHD symptomology was significantly more prevalent in SCT and already present from toddlerhood on, compared to controls. ADHD inattention symptoms were significantly increased in all karyotypes (XXX, XXY, and XYY), boys with XYY also showed significantly more hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms than controls. Inattentiveness was more pronounced with increasing age for SCT, in contrast to controls. Within the SCT group, 24% of the children had significantly elevated ADHD symptoms at a clinical level. Already from an early age on, SCT is associated with a risk for ADHD, suggesting that its neurodevelopmental risk lies anchored in early brain maturation. Studying this genetically vulnerable population allows for the prospective study of risk markers to facilitate early and preventive interventions.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.72

Current treatment options are often ineffective and associated with adverse effects, forcing families to seek alternative therapies for their children including products derived from cannabis. Reportsof miraculous cures and a public preferencefor 'natural' therapies have resulted in considerable public interest, and so this study aimed to characterize the use of cannabis in these individuals, as well as compare caregiver perceptions of efficacy and safety to objective evidence of seizure control and number of antiepileptic drugs used. METHODS: Families from the International CDKL5 Disorder Database were invited to complete questionnaires which included data relating to their child's current and past treatments, including use of any cannabis-derived preparations. Perceived effects on seizure control, as well as additional benefits and adverse effects were reported. Seizure frequency and number of antiepileptic drugs were compared between those actively using cannabis products and those who were not. Longitudinal analysis was performed on a subset of the study population to compare these same variables at pre-treatment and post-treatment time points. RESULTS: Three hundred and twelve caregivers answered questions regarding their child's use of antiepileptic medications. Of these, 82 (26%) described use of cannabis preparations either at present, or in the past, with the most common being cannabidiol. Of 70 caregivers that described their perceived effect on seizure control, more than two thirds reported an improvement in seizure control, either temporary (16%) or lasting (54%). Additional benefits included improvements in attention, cognition, and sleep. The majority of responses (78%) described adverse effects as 'none', though some reported an increase in sedation and gastrointestinal upset. There was no reduction in the median seizure frequency nor the number of different antiepileptic drugs, for those who were actively using cannabis products compared to those who were not. Similarly, individuals who were not using cannabis products at an initial time point had no differences in seizure frequency nor number of antiepileptic drugs at a second timepoint when they had started using this treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Although this is an observational study, limited by potential participation bias and the unreliable nature of unblinded self-assessment, it suggests that caregivers perceive cannabis products, especially cannabidiol, to have a tolerable adverse effect profile and adequate efficacy. Despite this, cannabis was not associated with a reduction in seizure frequency nor number of antiepileptic drugs when compared to non-users or when compared to pre-treatment. Randomized controlled trials are urgently needed to more reliably assess this treatment's safety and efficacy.","Journal Article, Observational Study, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

METHODS & PROCEDURES: We examined non-linguistic cognitive abilities in mono- and bilingual school-aged children (ages 8-12) with and without fDLD. Typically developing (TD) children (14 monolinguals, 12 bilinguals) and children with fDLD (28 monolinguals, 12 bilinguals) completed tasks measuring motor functions, procedural learning, executive attention and processing speed. Children were assigned as fDLD based on parental or professional concerns regarding children's daily language functioning. If no concerns were present, children were assigned as TD. Standardized English scores, non-verbal IQ scores and years of maternal education were also obtained. Likelihood ratios were used to examine how well each measure separated the fDLD versus TD groups. A binary logistic regression was used to test whether combined measures enhanced the prediction of identifying fDLD status. OUTCOMES & RESULTS: A combination of linguistic and non-linguistic measures provided the best distinction between fDLD and TD for both mono- and bilingual groups. For monolingual children, the combined measures include English language scores, functional motor abilities and processing speed, whereas for bilinguals, the combined measures include English language scores and procedural learning. CONCLUSIONS & IMPLICATIONS: A combination of non-linguistic and linguistic measures significantly improved the distinction between fDLD and TD for both mono- and bilingual groups. This study supports the possibility of using non-linguistic cognitive measures to identify fDLD in linguistically diverse settings. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: What is already known on the subject Given that standardized English language measures may fail to identify functional language disorder, we examined whether supplementing English language measures with non-linguistic cognitive tasks could resolve the problem. Our study is based on the hypothesis that non-linguistic cognitive abilities contribute to language processing and learning. This is further supported by previous findings that children with language disorder exhibit non-linguistic cognitive deficits. What this paper adds to existing knowledge The results indicated that a combination of linguistic and non-linguistic cognitive abilities increased the prediction of functional language disorder in both mono- and bilingual children. What are the potential or actual clinical implications of this work? This study supports the possibility of using non-linguistic cognitive measures to identify the risk of language disorder in linguistically diverse settings.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.11

To address this gap, we used a data-driven and diagnosis-agnostic approach to discover brain correlates of social communication differences in ASD, ADHD, and OCD, and subgroups of individuals who share similar patterns of brain-behavior associations. A machine learning pipeline (regression clustering) was used to discover the pattern of association between structural brain measures (volume, surface area, and cortical thickness) and social communication abilities. Participants (n = 416) included children with a diagnosis of ASD (n = 192, age = 12.0[5.6], 19% female), ADHD (n = 109, age = 11.1[4.1], 18% female), or OCD (n = 50, age = 12.3[4.2], 42% female), and typically developing controls (n = 65, age = 11.6[7.1], 48% female). The analyses revealed (1) associations with social communication abilities in distributed cortical and subcortical networks implicated in social behaviors, language, attention, memory, and executive functions, and (2) three data-driven, diagnosis-agnostic subgroups based on the patterns of association in the above networks.

METHODS: Clinical and genetic data from affected individuals were collected through Facebook-based family support group, GeneMatcher, and our network of collaborators. We investigated the impact of novel missense variants with respect to ATPase and helicase activity, stress granule (SG) formation, global translation, and their effect on embryonic development in zebrafish. SG formation was additionally analyzed in CRISPR/Cas9-mediated DHX30-deficient HEK293T and zebrafish models, along with in vivo behavioral assays. RESULTS: We identified 25 previously unreported individuals, ten of whom carry novel variants, two of which are recurrent, and provide evidence of gonadal mosaicism in one family. All 19 individuals harboring heterozygous missense variants within helicase core motifs (HCMs) have global developmental delay, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, and gait abnormalities. These variants impair the ATPase and helicase activity of DHX30, trigger SG formation, interfere with global translation, and cause developmental defects in a zebrafish model. Notably, 4 individuals harboring heterozygous variants resulting either in haploinsufficiency or truncated proteins presented with a milder clinical course, similar to an individual harboring a de novo mosaic HCM missense variant. Functionally, we established DHX30 as an ATP-dependent RNA helicase and as an evolutionary conserved factor in SG assembly. Based on the clinical course, the variant location, and type we establish two distinct clinical subtypes. DHX30 loss-of-function variants cause a milder phenotype whereas a severe phenotype is caused by HCM missense variants that, in addition to the loss of ATPase and helicase activity, lead to a detrimental gain-of-function with respect to SG formation. Behavioral characterization of dhx30-deficient zebrafish revealed altered sleep-wake activity and social interaction, partially resembling the human phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Our study highlights the usefulness of social media to define novel Mendelian disorders and exemplifies how functional analyses accompanied by clinical and genetic findings can define clinically distinct subtypes for ultra-rare disorders. Such approaches require close interdisciplinary collaboration between families/legal representatives of the affected individuals, clinicians, molecular genetics diagnostic laboratories, and research laboratories.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Objective: To investigate baseline structural neuroimaging differences between individuals at CHR and healthy controls as well as between participants at CHR who later developed a psychotic disorder (CHR-PS+) and those who did not (CHR-PS-). Design, Setting, and Participants: In this case-control study, baseline T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data were pooled from 31 international sites participating in the ENIGMA Clinical High Risk for Psychosis Working Group. CHR status was assessed using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental States or Structured Interview for Prodromal Syndromes. MRI scans were processed using harmonized protocols and analyzed within a mega-analysis and meta-analysis framework from January to October 2020. Main Outcomes and Measures: Measures of regional cortical thickness (CT), surface area, and subcortical volumes were extracted from T1-weighted MRI scans. Independent variables were group (CHR group vs control group) and conversion status (CHR-PS+ group vs CHR-PS- group vs control group). Results: Of the 3169 included participants, 1428 (45.1%) were female, and the mean (SD; range) age was 21.1 (4.9; 9.5-39.9) years. This study included 1792 individuals at CHR and 1377 healthy controls. Using longitudinal clinical information, 253 in the CHR-PS+ group, 1234 in the CHR-PS- group, and 305 at CHR without follow-up data were identified. Compared with healthy controls, individuals at CHR exhibited widespread lower CT measures (mean [range] Cohen d = -0.13 [-0.17 to -0.09]), but not surface area or subcortical volume. Lower CT measures in the fusiform, superior temporal, and paracentral regions were associated with psychosis conversion (mean Cohen d = -0.22; 95% CI, -0.35 to 0.10). Among healthy controls, compared with those in the CHR-PS+ group, age showed a stronger negative association with left fusiform CT measures (F = 9.8; P < .001; q < .001) and left paracentral CT measures (F = 5.9; P = .005; q = .02). Effect sizes representing lower CT associated with psychosis conversion resembled patterns of CT differences observed in ENIGMA studies of schizophrenia (rho = 0.35; 95% CI, 0.12 to 0.55; P = .004) and individuals with 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome and a psychotic disorder diagnosis (rho = 0.43; 95% CI, 0.20 to 0.61; P = .001). Conclusions and Relevance: This study provides evidence for widespread subtle, lower CT measures in individuals at CHR. The pattern of CT measure differences in those in the CHR-PS+ group was similar to those reported in other large-scale investigations of psychosis. Additionally, a subset of these regions displayed abnormal age associations. Widespread disruptions in CT coupled with abnormal age associations in those at CHR may point to disruptions in postnatal brain developmental processes.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

The assessed bone age indicates the actual level of growth, whereby a large discrepancy between the assessed and chronological age might point to a growth disorder. Hence, skeletal bone age assessment is used to screen the possibility of growth abnormalities, genetic problems, and endocrine disorders. Usually, the manual screening is assessed through X-ray images of the non-dominant hand using the Greulich-Pyle (GP) or Tanner-Whitehouse (TW) approach. The GP uses a standard hand atlas, which will be the reference point to predict the bone age of a patient, while the TW uses a scoring mechanism to assess the bone age using several regions of interest information. However, both approaches are heavily dependent on individual domain knowledge and expertise, which is prone to high bias in inter and intra-observer results. Hence, an automated bone age assessment system, which is referred to as Attention-Xception Network (AXNet) is proposed to automatically predict the bone age accurately. The proposed AXNet consists of two parts, which are image normalization and bone age regression modules. The image normalization module will transform each X-ray image into a standardized form so that the regressor network can be trained using better input images. This module will first extract the hand region from the background, which is then rotated to an upright position using the angle calculated from the four key-points of interest. Then, the masked and rotated hand image will be aligned such that it will be positioned in the middle of the image. Both of the masked and rotated images will be obtained through existing state-of-the-art deep learning methods. The last module will then predict the bone age through the Attention-Xception network that incorporates multiple layers of spatial-attention mechanism to emphasize the important features for more accurate bone age prediction. From the experimental results, the proposed AXNet achieves the lowest mean absolute error and mean squared error of 7.699 months and 108.869 months(2), respectively. Therefore, the proposed AXNet has demonstrated its potential for practical clinical use with an error of less than one year to assist the experts or radiologists in evaluating the bone age objectively.",Journal Article,,0.21

METHODS: The study utilised data from the first (1998) and second (2013/14) child and adolescent components of the National Surveys of Mental Health and Wellbeing. Both surveys identified nationally representative samples of Australian young people aged 4-17 years, living in private dwellings. Information was collected from parents and 13- to 17-year-olds about mental disorders, mental health problems, risk behaviours and tobacco smoking. RESULTS: In the 2013/14 survey, the rate of current tobacco smoking among those with a mental disorder was 20% compared to 5% in those without a mental disorder. Rates were highest for young people with conduct disorder (50%), major depressive disorder (24%) and anxiety disorders (19%). In 2013/14, 38% of current tobacco smokers had a mental disorder and 32% reported self-harm and/or suicidal ideation vs 10% and 5%, respectively, among adolescents who had never smoked. Females with mental disorders or reporting self-harm or suicidal ideation had higher rates of current smoking than males. Other significant factors associated with current smoking included school-related problems, binge eating and having had more than one sexual partner. CONCLUSION: While smoking rates in 13- to 17-year-olds with mental disorders had declined since 1998, the strength of the association between mental disorders and smoking had increased, especially among females.

Novelty seeking (NS) assesses preference for seeking novel experiences, which is linked to sensitivity to reward environmental cues. METHODS: A subset of 14-year-old adolescents (IMAGEN) with the top 20% ranked high-NS scores was used to identify high-NS-associated multimodal components by supervised fusion. These features were then used to longitudinally predict five different risk scales for the same and unseen subjects (an independent dataset of subjects at 19 years of age that was not used in predictive modeling training at 14 years of age) (within IMAGEN, n approximately 1100) and even for the corresponding symptom scores of five types of patient cohorts (non-IMAGEN), including drinking (n = 313), smoking (n = 104), attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (n = 320), major depressive disorder (n = 81), and schizophrenia (n = 147), as well as to classify different patient groups with diagnostic labels. RESULTS: Multimodal biomarkers, including the prefrontal cortex, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus, associated with high NS in 14-year-old adolescents were identified. The prediction models built on these features are able to longitudinally predict five different risk scales, including alcohol drinking, smoking, hyperactivity, depression, and psychosis for the same and unseen 19-year-old adolescents and even predict the corresponding symptom scores of five types of patient cohorts. Furthermore, the identified reward-related multimodal features can classify among attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia with an accuracy of 87.2%. CONCLUSIONS: Adolescents with higher NS scores can be used to reveal brain alterations in the reward-related system, implicating potential higher risk for subsequent development of multiple disorders. The identified high-NS-associated multimodal reward-related signatures may serve as a transdiagnostic neuroimaging biomarker to predict disease risks or severity.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.6

Very early detection and timely targeted intervention has potential to improve outcomes for these children and support them to reach their full life potential. Early Moves aims to identify early biomarkers, including general movements (GMs), for babies at risk of cognitive impairment, allowing early intervention within critical developmental windows to enable these children to have the best possible start to life. METHOD AND ANALYSIS: Early Moves is a double-masked prospective cohort study that will recruit 3000 term and preterm babies from a secondary care setting. Early Moves will determine the diagnostic value of abnormal GMs (at writhing and fidgety age) for mild, moderate and severe cognitive delay at 2 years measured by the Bayley-4. Parents will use the Baby Moves smartphone application to video their babies' GMs. Trained GMs assessors will be masked to any risk factors and assessors of the primary outcome will be masked to the GMs result. Automated scoring of GMs will be developed through applying machine-based learning to the data and the predictive value for an abnormal GM will be investigated. Screening algorithms for identification of children at risk of cognitive impairment, using the GM assessment (GMA), and routinely collected social and environmental profile data will be developed to allow more accurate prediction of cognitive outcome at 2 years. A cost evaluation for GMA implementation in preparation for national implementation will be undertaken including exploring the relationship between cognitive status and healthcare utilisation, medical costs, health-related quality of life and caregiver burden.

We tested the association between maternal anxiety and depressive symptoms and paternal emotional problems with CD and ODD symptoms in adolescent offspring aged 17. METHODS: Data was from the Raine Study, a birth cohort study based in Western Australia. Offspring CD and ODD symptoms at age 17 years were measured using the DSM-oriented scales of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale (DASS) was used to assess maternal depressive and anxiety symptoms, and a self-reported questionnaire measured paternal emotional problems when the offspring was 10 years. Negative binomial regression model was used to explore associations. RESULTS: Adjusting for potential confounding factors, we found an increased risk of CD symptoms in the offspring of mothers with anxiety [RR = 1.76 (95%CI; 1.08-2.86)], depressive [RR = 1.40 (95%CI; 1.01-1.95)], and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms [RR = 2.24 (95%CI 1.35-3.72)]. We also found an increased risk of ODD symptoms in offspring of mothers with depressive [RR = 1.24 (95%CI 1.02-1.52)], but not anxiety symptoms [RR = 1.23 (95%CI 0.92-1.67)]. No associations were seen with paternal emotional problems. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that adolescents whose mothers reported anxiety, depressive, and comorbid anxiety and depressive symptoms had a higher risk of CD and ODD symptoms at age 17. The findings have implications for preventive strategies.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.13

Very few studies have examined the longitudinal relationship of mental health with health behavior and HRQoL among children. This study aimed to investigate the associations of diet quality, PA, SB, and HRQoL among children with mental health disorders throughout childhood. Methods: We linked data from grade five students aged primarily 10 and 11 years who participated in the Raising Healthy Eating and Active Living (REAL) Kids Alberta survey in 2012 in the Canadian province of Alberta with their administrative health care data from birth to 2012. Mental health outcomes included internalizing disorder and attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) or Tenth Revision, Canadian version (ICD-10-CA). The HRQoL was measured by the EQ-5D-Y, a five-dimensional descriptive system for children and youth. We applied negative binomial regressions to examine the associations between health behaviors, HRQoL, and mental health. Results: Of the 1,352 participating students, 12.31 and 8.32% had a diagnosis of internalizing disorders and ADHDs, respectively, during childhood from birth to the ages of 10-11 years. Students in the highest tertile for diet quality, relative to the lowest tertile, were 56% less likely to have diagnoses of internalizing disorders (incidence rate ratio, IRR = 0.44, 95% CI = 0.23-0.85). Students engaged in less PA (vs. more PA) were more likely to be diagnosed for internalizing disorders (IRR = 1.98, 95% CI = 1.19-3.30). Poorer diet quality, low PA, excessive use of computers/video games, and watching TV were significantly associated with more diagnoses of ADHDs. Children who experienced some or a lot of problems in ""feeling worried, sad, or unhappy"" and ""having pain or discomfort"" were more likely to receive diagnoses of internalizing disorders and ADHDs, respectively. Conclusions: These observed associations suggest that health promotion programs targeting promoting diet quality, PA, and HRQoL and reducing SB among children may contribute to improving mental health.",Journal Article,The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.,0.32

The mechanisms that may be linking cognitive difficulties, emotion regulation and mental health are not known. AIMS: The current study examined whether adaptive and maladaptive (dysregulated) emotion regulation mediated the link between different cognitive control processes (working memory, inhibition and shifting) and internalizing/externalizing symptoms in children with NDDs. METHODS: Participants included 48 children (8-13 years of age) with one or more diagnoses of autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, cerebral palsy and learning disability, who were enrolled in a larger study of cognitive behaviour therapy targeting emotion regulation. Multiple mediation analyses were implemented using the PROCESS macro. The mediation effects of adaptive and maladaptive emotion regulation were examined on the relationships between (1) working memory and internalizing/externalizing symptoms, (2) inhibition and internalizing/externalizing symptoms and (3) shifting and internalizing/externalizing symptoms. All data were collected prior to intervention, at baseline. RESULTS: Shifting, inhibitory control and working memory predicted increased emotion dysregulation, which functioned as a full mediator to both internalizing and externalizing problems in children with NDDs. CONCLUSIONS: In the presence of emotionally triggering situations, children with greater cognitive challenges experience greater maladaptive emotion regulation, which results in both internalizing and externalizing problems. For youth with NDDs, therapeutic plans that include strengthening of working memory, inhibition and shifting abilities in addition to emotion regulation skills training may be helpful in alleviating externalizing and internalizing behaviour.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.26

Human carriers display a high prevalence of micro- and macrocephaly in deletion and duplication carriers, respectively. The underlying brain structural diversity remains largely unknown. We systematically called CNVs in 38 cohorts from the large-scale ENIGMA-CNV collaboration and the UK Biobank and identified 28 1q21.1 distal deletion and 22 duplication carriers and 37,088 non-carriers (48% male) derived from 15 distinct magnetic resonance imaging scanner sites. With standardized methods, we compared subcortical and cortical brain measures (all) and cognitive performance (UK Biobank only) between carrier groups also testing for mediation of brain structure on cognition. We identified positive dosage effects of copy number on intracranial volume (ICV) and total cortical surface area, with the largest effects in frontal and cingulate cortices, and negative dosage effects on caudate and hippocampal volumes. The carriers displayed distinct cognitive deficit profiles in cognitive tasks from the UK Biobank with intermediate decreases in duplication carriers and somewhat larger in deletion carriers-the latter potentially mediated by ICV or cortical surface area.

However, the phenotype of regionally specific increased cortical thickness observed in ASD may be driven by several independent biological processes that influence the gray/white matter boundary, such as synaptic pruning, myelination, or atypical migration. Here, we propose to use the boundary sharpness coefficient (BSC), a proxy for alterations in microstructure at the cortical gray/white matter boundary, to investigate brain differences in individuals with ASD, including factors that may influence ASD-related heterogeneity (age, sex, and intelligence quotient). Using a vertex-based meta-analysis and a large multicenter structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset, with a total of 1136 individuals, 415 with ASD (112 female; 303 male), and 721 controls (283 female; 438 male), we observed that individuals with ASD had significantly greater BSC in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and left inferior frontal gyrus indicating an abrupt transition (high contrast) between white matter and cortical intensities. Individuals with ASD under 18 had significantly greater BSC in the bilateral superior temporal gyrus and right postcentral gyrus; individuals with ASD over 18 had significantly increased BSC in the bilateral precuneus and superior temporal gyrus. Increases were observed in different brain regions in males and females, with larger effect sizes in females. BSC correlated with ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Score in individuals with ASD in the right medial temporal pole. Importantly, there was a significant spatial overlap between maps of the effect of diagnosis on BSC when compared with cortical thickness. These results invite studies to use BSC as a possible new measure of cortical development in ASD and to further examine the microstructural underpinnings of BSC-related differences and their impact on measures of cortical morphology.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

To that end, the ENIGMA-CNV WG has collated CNV and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data from ~49,000 individuals across 38 global research sites, yielding one of the largest studies to date on the effects of CNVs on brain structures in the general population. The 22q-ENIGMA WG includes 12 international research centers that assessed over 533 individuals with a confirmed 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, 40 with 22q11.2 duplications, and 333 typically developing controls, creating the largest-ever 22q11.2 CNV neuroimaging data set. In this review, we outline the ENIGMA infrastructure and procedures for multi-site analysis of CNVs and MRI data. So far, ENIGMA has identified effects of the 22q11.2, 16p11.2 distal, 15q11.2, and 1q21.1 distal CNVs on subcortical and cortical brain structures. Each CNV is associated with differences in cognitive, neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric traits, with characteristic patterns of brain structural abnormalities. Evidence of gene-dosage effects on distinct brain regions also emerged, providing further insight into genotype-phenotype relationships. Taken together, these results offer a more comprehensive picture of molecular mechanisms involved in typical and atypical brain development. This ""genotype-first"" approach also contributes to our understanding of the etiopathogenesis of brain disorders.

It is unclear if ANS dysfunction is present years prior to the onset of motor symptoms of HD. To bridge this gap in knowledge, we compared crude markers of ANS function between children with the gene-expansion that causes HD (GE group) who were decades from their predicted motor onset and gene-non-expanded children (GNE group). METHODS: We included participants from the Kids-HD study who were <18 years old. Linear mixed effects regression models were constructed that controlled for sex, age, and BMI, and included a random effect per participant and per family. We compared resting heart rate (rHR), core body temperature (CBT), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) between the GE (n = 84) and GNE (n = 238) groups. We then grouped participants from the GE group based on their predicted years to onset (YTO) and compared their vital signs to the GNE group. RESULTS: The GE group had higher rHR ( = 3.83, p = 0.0064), SBP ( = 2.38, p = 0.032), and CBT ( = 0.16, t = 2.92, p = 0.007). The mean rHR and CBT became significantly elevated compared to the GNE group in participants who had 15-25 YTO and those who had <15 YTO. The mean SBP of participants who had 25-35 YTO was significantly elevated compared to the GNE group. CONCLUSION: ANS dysfunction in HD seems to occur approximately 20 years prior to the predicted onset of motor symptoms of HD.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,0.02

METHOD: Participants were initially recruited at age 14 in high schools for the longitudinal IMAGEN study. All measures presented here were assessed at follow-ups at age 19 and at age 22, respectively. Perceived stress was only assessed once at age 22. Ever users of cannabis (N = 552) gave qualitative and quantitative information on cannabis use and psychotic-like experiences using the Community Assessment of Psychic Experiences (CAPE). Of those, nearly all n = 549 reported to have experienced at least one psychotic experience of any form at age 19.

Change in cannabis use was not significantly associated with psychotic-like experiences at age 19 or 22. In exploratory analysis, we observed a positive association between perceived stress and the experience of psychotic experiences at age 22. CONCLUSION: Age of first use of cannabis influenced trajectories of young cannabis users with later onset leading to higher increase, whereas the frequency of psychotic-like experiences was not associated with a change in cannabis use.

Maternal states associated with ADHD include obesity, pre-eclampsia, smoking, low socioeconomic status (SES), stress, autoimmune disease, and asthma. Maternal states associated with TS include low SES, depression, and autoimmune diseases. Diverse maternal inflammatory states in pregnancy are associated with common offspring NDDs.

The diagnosis of a TTN-related myopathy is, however, often not straightforward due to clinico-pathological overlap with other myopathies and the prevalence of TTN variants in control populations. Here, we present a combined clinico-pathological, genetic and biophysical approach to the diagnosis of TTN-related myopathies and the pathogenicity ascertainment of TTN missense variants. We identified 30 patients with a primary TTN-related congenital myopathy (CM) and two truncating variants, or one truncating and one missense TTN variant, or homozygous for one TTN missense variant. We found that TTN-related myopathies show considerable overlap with other myopathies but are strongly suggested by a combination of certain clinico-pathological features. Presentation was typically at birth with the clinical course characterized by variable progression of weakness, contractures, scoliosis and respiratory symptoms but sparing of extraocular muscles. Cardiac involvement depended on the variant position. Our biophysical analyses demonstrated that missense mutations associated with CMs are strongly destabilizing and exert their effect when expressed on a truncating background or in homozygosity. We hypothesise that destabilizing TTN missense mutations phenocopy truncating variants and are a key pathogenic feature of recessive titinopathies that might be amenable to therapeutic intervention.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Families were recruited at the time of the child's routine clinic appointment or inpatient visit. Information was extracted from participants' electronic medical records (EMR) and parent reports; participants were screened for comorbidities using standardized screening measures. Data were collected from 289 participants (47% female, 53% male), and mean age was 7.9years (2months to 17years). Twenty-nine percent of participants had primary generalized epilepsy, 63% focal epilepsy, 0.3% combined generalized and focal epilepsy, and 8% could not be distinguished. There were a variety of epilepsy risk factors including prematurity (10%), intraventricular hemorrhage (7%), neonatal seizures (8%), and febrile seizures (17%). The most common etiologies were cerebral malformations (13%) and genetic disorders (25%). Numerous participants had documented comorbidities including developmental delay (56%), intellectual disability (20%), headaches (16%), attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (23%), and autism (7%).

This review aimed to synthesize the literature on the risk of clinical eating disorders in adolescents with obesity, discuss challenges with assessing risk, and examine implications for clinical practice and future research. Obesity and eating disorders can coexist resulting in exacerbated physical and psychological health issues. Recognized eating disorder risk factors, including body dissatisfaction, poor self-esteem, depression, and engaging in dieting behaviors, are elevated and frequently reported in adolescents with obesity, highlighting a vulnerability to the development of eating disorders. Unsupervised dieting to manage weight may exacerbate eating disorder risk, while structured and supervised weight management is likely to reduce eating disorder risk for most adolescents. However, some adolescents may present to an obesity service with an undiagnosed eating disorder or may develop an eating disorder during or following treatment. We conclude that a risk management approach, with screening or monitoring for eating disorder-related risk factors and behaviors, should be utilized to identify those at risk. Future research to identify eating disorder risk factors specific to adolescents with obesity is required to inform screening and monitoring protocols, patient care, and address current knowledge gaps.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.02

METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, a questionnaire was sent to former NFL players. Respondents reported SRC history (categorical: 0; 1-2; 3-5; 6-9; 10+ concussions), number of moderate-to-vigorous aerobic and resistance exercise sessions per week, diet quality (Rapid Eating Assessment for Participants-Shortened) and average nightly sleep duration. Outcomes were Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System Cognitive Function, Depression, and Anxiety, and Neuro-QoL Emotional-Behavioral Dyscontrol domain T-scores. Multivariable linear regression models were fit for each outcome with SRC history, exercise frequency, diet quality and sleep duration as explanatory variables alongside select covariates. RESULTS: Multivariable regression models (n=1784) explained approximately 33%-38% of the variance in each outcome.

This similarity suggests that the cognitive impairment(s) contributing to the structural language deficits in ASD and ADHD may be shared. Previous studies have speculated that procedural memory deficits may be the shared cognitive impairment. The procedural deficit hypothesis (PDH) argues that language deficits can be explained by differences in the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network. This hypothesis is based on the premise that the neural structures comprising the procedural network support language learning. In this study, we aimed to test the PDH in children with ASD, ADHD, and typical development (TD). Methods: One hundred and sixty-three participants (ages 10-21): 91 with ASD, 26 with ADHD, and 46 with TD, completed standardized measures of cognitive and language ability as well as structural magnetic resonance imaging. We compared the structural language abilities, the neural structures underlying the procedural memory network, and the relationship between structural language and neural structure across diagnostic groups. Results: Our analyses revealed that while the structural language abilities differed across ASD, ADHD, and TD groups, the thickness, area, and volume of the structures supporting the procedural memory network were not significantly different between diagnostic groups. Also, several neural structures were associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups. Only two of these structures, the inferior frontal gyrus, and the left superior parietal gyrus, are known to be linked to the procedural memory network. Conclusions: The inferior frontal gyrus and the left superior parietal gyrus, have well-established roles in language learning independent of their role as part of the procedural memory system. Other structures such as the caudate and cerebellum, with critical roles in the procedural memory network, were not associated with structural language abilities across diagnostic groups.

It has been hypothesized that hypotension accompanying anesthesia could be contributory. We hypothesized that among children exposed to multiple anesthetics prior to age 3, children developing adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes would be more likely to have intraoperative hypotension. METHODS: Two previously published study cohorts were utilized for analysis: the retrospective and prospective Mayo Anesthesia Safety in Kids cohorts. The two lowest consecutive systolic blood pressure measurements were abstracted and standardized by calculating a z-score for noninvasive blood pressure reference ranges for children. The lowest systolic blood pressure z-score (continuous variable) and intraoperative hypotension (lowest systolic blood pressure z-score <-1.0) were used to assess the association of intraoperative hypotension with the incidence of learning disabilities or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder(retrospective cohort) and factor scores/cluster membership (prospective cohort). RESULTS: One hunderd and sixteen and 206 children with multiple exposures to general anesthesia were analyzed in the retrospective and prospective cohorts with mean lowest systolic blood pressure z-scores -0.26 (SD 1.02) and -0.62 (SD 1.10), respectively. There was no overall association of the lowest z-score or hypotension with learning disabilities or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in the retrospective cohort. In the prospective cohort, there was no overall association of the lowest systolic blood pressure or hypotension with factor scores or cluster membership.

Here, we used a virtual-histology technique and gene expression data from the Allen Human Brain Atlas to compare the regional profiles of longitudinal cortical thinning through life (4004 magnetic resonance images [MRIs]) with those of gene expression for several neuronal and non-neuronal cell types. The results were replicated in three independent datasets. We found that inter-regional profiles of cortical thinning related to expression profiles for marker genes of CA1 pyramidal cells, astrocytes and, microglia during development and in aging. During the two stages of life, the relationships went in opposite directions: greater gene expression related to less thinning in development and vice versa in aging. The association between cortical thinning and cell-specific gene expression was also present in mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's Disease. These findings suggest a role of astrocytes and microglia in promoting and supporting neuronal growth and dendritic structures through life that affects cortical thickness during development, aging, and neurodegeneration. Overall, the findings contribute to our understanding of the neurobiology underlying variations in MRI-derived estimates of cortical thinning through life and late-life disease.","Clinical Trial, Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Without early identification and treatment, eating disorders may run a long-term course. Objective: To characterize any associations among disordered eating behaviors (DEBs) and other mental health disorders and to identify early associations with the development of symptoms over time. Design, Setting, and Participants: This multicenter, population-based, longitudinal cohort study used data from baseline (collected in 2010), follow-up 1 (collected in 2012), and follow-up 2 (collected in 2015) of the IMAGEN Study, which included adolescents recruited from 8 European sites. The present study assessed data from 1623 healthy adolescents, aged 14 years at baseline, recruited from high schools. Data analyses were performed from January 2018 to September 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: Body mass index (BMI), mental health symptoms, substance use behaviors, and personality variables were investigated as time-varying associations of DEBs (dieting, binge eating, and purging) or change in BMI over time. Polygenic risk scores were calculated to investigate genetic contributions associated with BMI, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and neuroticism to DEBs. Results: In this cohort study of 1623 adolescents (829 girls [51.1%]) recruited at a mean (SD) age of 14.5 (0.4) years and followed up at ages 16 and 19 years, 278 adolescents (17.1%) reported binge eating, 334 adolescents (20.6%) reported purging, and 356 adolescents (21.9%) reported dieting at 14, 16, or 19 years.

Polygenetic risk scores for BMI were associated with dieting (at 14 years: OR, 1.27; lower bound 95% CI, 1.08; at 16 years: OR, 1.38; lower bound 95% CI, 1.17); ADHD, with purging (at 16 years: OR, 1.25; lower bound 95% CI, 1.08; at 19 years, OR, 1.23; lower bound 95% CI, 1.06); and neuroticism, with binge eating (at 14 years: OR, 1.32; lower bound 95% CI, 1.11; at 16 years: OR, 1.24; lower bound 95% CI, 1.06), highlighting distinct etiologic overlaps between these traits. The DEBs predated other mental health problems, with dieting at 14 years associated with future symptoms of depression (OR, 2.53; 95% CI, 1.56-4.10), generalized anxiety (OR, 2.27; 95% CI, 1.14-4.51), deliberate self-harm (OR, 2.10; 95% CI, 1.51-4.24), emotional problems (OR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.08-1.43), and smoking (OR, 2.16; 95% CI, 1.36-3.48). Purging at 14 years was also associated with future depression (OR, 2.87; 95% CI, 1.69-5.01) and anxiety (OR, 2.48; 95% CI, 1.49-4.12) symptoms.

Each participant's functional network graphs were computed using five graph metrics. In diagnosis-based comparisons, an analysis of covariance was performed to compare all NDDs to TD, followed by pairwise comparisons between NDDs. In the dimensional approach, participants' functional network graphs were correlated with continuous behavioural measures, and a data-driven k-means clustering analysis was applied to determine if subgroups of participants were seen, without diagnostic information having been included. In the diagnosis-based comparisons, children with NDDs did not differ significantly from the TD group and the NDD categorical groups also did not differ significantly from each other, across all graph metrics. In the dimensional, diagnostic-independent approach, however, subcortical functional connectivity was significantly correlated with participants' general adaptive functioning across all participants. The clustering analysis identified an optimal solution of two clusters, and participants assigned in the same data-driven cluster were highly heterogeneous in diagnosis. Neither cluster exclusively contained a specific diagnostic group, nor did NDDs separate cleanly from TDs. Each participant's distance ratio between the two clusters was significantly correlated with general adaptive functioning, social deficits and attentional problems.

METHOD: Children aged 7-12 years with NF1 (n = 60) were compared with typically developing children (n = 36). Poor word readers with NF1 were classified according to impairment type (i.e., phonological, surface, mixed), and their reading subskills were compared. A hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to identify predictors of word reading. RESULTS: Compared to controls, children with NF1 demonstrated significantly poorer literacy abilities. Of the 49 children with NF1 classified as poor readers, 20 (41%) were classified with phonological dyslexia, 24 (49%) with mixed dyslexia, and 5 (10%) fell outside classification categories. Children with mixed dyslexia displayed the most severe reading impairments. Stronger working memory, better receptive language, and fewer inattentive behaviors predicted better word reading skills. CONCLUSIONS: The majority of children with NF1 experience deficits in key reading skills which are essential for them to become successful readers. Weaknesses in working memory, receptive language, and attention are associated with reading difficulties in children with NF1.",Journal Article,,0.02

In this voxel-based morphometry (VBM) study, regional grey matter volumes (GMV) were compared between 22 children with ADHD, 18 children with ASD and 17 typically developing (TD) children aged 8 to 12 years old, controlling for age and total intracranial volume. When compared to TD children or children with ASD, children with ADHD had a larger left precuneus, and a smaller right thalamus, suggesting that these brain abnormalities are specific to ADHD relative to ASD.

Inscapes, a non-social and non-verbal movie paradigm, has been introduced to increase attention, thus mitigating head motion, while reducing the task-induced activations found during typical movie watching. Inscapes has not yet been validated for use in magnetoencephalography (MEG), and it has yet to be shown whether its effects are stable in clinical populations. Across typically developing (N = 32) children and adolescents and those with ASD (N = 46) and ADHD (N = 42), we demonstrate that head motion is reduced during Inscapes. Due to the task state evoked by movie paradigms, we also expectedly observed concomitant modulations in local neural activity (oscillatory power) and functional connectivity (phase and envelope coupling) in intrinsic resting-state networks and across the frequency spectra compared to a fixation cross resting-state. Increases in local activity were accompanied by decreases in low-frequency connectivity within and between resting-state networks, primarily the visual network, suggesting that task-state evoked by Inscapes moderates ongoing and spontaneous cortical inhibition that forms the idling intrinsic networks found during a fixation cross resting-state. Importantly, these effects were similar in ASD and ADHD, making Inscapes a well-suited advancement for investigations of resting brain function in young and clinical populations.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Declaration of Competing Interest E.

Children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (NDD) are often excluded and experience more loneliness than their typically developing peers. This scoping review aims to identify the type of studies conducted in children with NDD to determine the effects of loneliness and/or social isolation. Three electronic databases (Ovid MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO) were searched from inception until 5 February 2019. Two independent reviewers screened the citations for inclusion and extracted data from the included articles. Quantitative (i.e., frequency analysis) and qualitative analyses (i.e., content analysis) were completed. From our search, 5768 citations were screened, 29 were read in full, and 12 were included. Ten were case-control comparisons with cross-sectional assessment of various outcomes, which limited inference. Autism spectrum disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and learning disorder were the most commonly studied NDD. This review showed that loneliness among children with NDD was associated with negative consequences on mental health, behaviour, and psychosocial/emotional development, with a likely long-term impact in adulthood. Lack of research in this area suggests that loneliness is not yet considered a problem in children with NDD. More studies are warranted using prospective designs and a larger sample size with a focus on the dynamic aspect of loneliness development.","Journal Article, Review",,0.06

However, a growing body of evidence supports an alternative theory in which loss of function may also influence the pathology.This theory is predicated on the notion that HTT is known to be a vital gene for brain development. mHTT is expressed throughout life and could conceivably have deleterious effects on brain development. The end event in the disease is, of course, neurodegeneration; however the process by which that occurs may be rooted in the pathophysiology of aberrant development.To date, there have been multiple studies evaluating molecular and cellular mechanisms of abnormal development in HD, as well as studies investigating abnormal brain development in HD animal models. However, direct study of how mHTT could affect neurodevelopment in humans has not been approached until recent years. The current review will focus on the most recent findings of a unique study of children at-risk for HD, the Kids-HD study.

The underlying neurobiology behind these differences is not well understood. OBJECTIVE: To determine neurobiologic correlates of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls in 6 disorders: attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD), bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and schizophrenia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Profiles of group differences in cortical thickness between cases and controls were generated using T1-weighted magnetic resonance images. Similarity between interregional profiles of cell-specific gene expression and those in the group differences in cortical thickness were investigated in each disorder. Next, principal component analysis was used to reveal a shared profile of group difference in thickness across the disorders. Analysis for gene coexpression, clustering, and enrichment for genes associated with these disorders were conducted. Data analysis was conducted between June and December 2019. The analysis included 145 cohorts across 6 psychiatric disorders drawn from the ENIGMA consortium. The numbers of cases and controls in each of the 6 disorders were as follows: ADHD: 1814 and 1602; ASD: 1748 and 1770; BD: 1547 and 3405; MDD: 2658 and 3572; OCD: 2266 and 2007; and schizophrenia: 2688 and 3244. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Interregional profiles of group difference in cortical thickness between cases and controls. RESULTS: A total of 12 721 cases and 15 600 controls, ranging from ages 2 to 89 years, were included in this study. Interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness for each of the 6 psychiatric disorders were associated with profiles of gene expression specific to pyramidal (CA1) cells, astrocytes (except for BD), and microglia (except for OCD); collectively, gene-expression profiles of the 3 cell types explain between 25% and 54% of variance in interregional profiles of group differences in cortical thickness. Principal component analysis revealed a shared profile of difference in cortical thickness across the 6 disorders (48% variance explained); interregional profile of this principal component 1 was associated with that of the pyramidal-cell gene expression (explaining 56% of interregional variation). Coexpression analyses of these genes revealed 2 clusters: (1) a prenatal cluster enriched with genes involved in neurodevelopmental (axon guidance) processes and (2) a postnatal cluster enriched with genes involved in synaptic activity and plasticity-related processes. These clusters were enriched with genes associated with all 6 psychiatric disorders. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, shared neurobiologic processes were associated with differences in cortical thickness across multiple psychiatric disorders. These processes implicate a common role of prenatal development and postnatal functioning of the cerebral cortex in these disorders.",Journal Article,,0.3

The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to (a) evaluate the efficacy and safety of pharmacotherapy for the treatment of ADHD symptoms in ASD and (b) distil findings for clinical translation. METHODS: We searched electronic databases and clinical trial registries (1992 onwards). We selected randomized controlled trials conducted in participants <25 years of age, diagnosed with ASD that evaluated ADHD outcomes (hyperactivity/impulsivity and inattention) following treatment with stimulants (methylphenidate or amphetamines), atomoxetine, alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists, antipsychotics, tricyclic antidepressants, bupropion, modafinil, venlafaxine, or a combination, in comparison with placebo, any of the listed medications, or behavioral therapies. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies (4 methylphenidate, 4 atomoxetine, 1 guanfacine, 14 antipsychotic, 1 venlafaxine, and 1 tianeptine) were included. Methylphenidate reduced hyperactivity (parent-rated: standardized mean difference [SMD] = -.63, 95%CI = -.95,-.30; teacher-rated: SMD = -.81, 95%CI = -1.43,-.19) and inattention (parent-rated: SMD = -.36, 95%CI = -.64,-.07; teacher-rated: SMD = -.30, 95%CI = -.49,-.11). Atomoxetine reduced inattention (parent-rated: SMD = -.54, 95%CI = -.98,-.09; teacher/investigator-rated: SMD = -0.38, 95%CI = -0.75, -0.01) and parent-rated hyperactivity (parent-rated: SMD = -.49, 95%CI = -.76,-.23; teacher-rated: SMD = -.43, 95%CI = -.92, .06). Indirect evidence for significant reductions in hyperactivity with second-generation antipsychotics was also found. Quality of evidence for all interventions was low/very low. Methylphenidate was associated with a nonsignificant elevated risk of dropout due to adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Direct pooled evidence supports the efficacy and tolerability of methylphenidate or atomoxetine for treatment of ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD. The current review highlights the efficacy of standard ADHD pharmacotherapy for treatment of ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD. Consideration of the benefits weighed against the limitations of safety/efficacy data and lack of data evaluating long-term continuation is undertaken to help guide clinical decision-making regarding treatment of co-occurring ADHD symptoms in children and youth with ASD.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Systematic Review",,1.0

A retrospective medical record review was used to describe short-term developmental outcomes of children with AHT and identify predictors of poorer outcomes. METHOD: Children with AHT who received follow up by the hospital's rehabilitation department for 12 to 24 months post-injury were included in this review. Data for 85 children were collected on hearing, vision, gross motor, fine motor, speech and language, cognition, play, adaptive functioning, behaviour and personal-social skills. RESULTS: Global assessment found 42% of children had a good recovery, 34% had a moderate disability and 24% had a severe disability. For whom there was data, more than half had abnormal cognition, behaviour and personal-social skills, whilst more than a third had abnormal speech and language, neurological signs on last assessment, vision, play skills, and gross and fine motor skills. Factors that predicted poorer prognosis across all developmental domains included paediatric intensive care unit admission, longer length of hospital stay, breathing difficulty and lower Glasgow Coma Scale on presentation.

Furthermore, genetic risk variants of neurodevelopmental disorders have been found to be enriched at loci associated with DNAm patterns, referred to as methylation quantitative trait loci (mQTLs). METHODS: We conducted two epigenome-wide association studies in individuals with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (aged 4-18 years) using DNA extracted from saliva. DNAm data generated on the Illumina Human Methylation 450 K array were used to examine the interaction between genetic variation and DNAm patterns associated with these disorders. RESULTS: Using linear regression followed by principal component analysis, individuals with the most endorsed symptoms of ADHD or OCD were found to have significantly more distinct DNAm patterns from controls, as compared to all cases. This suggested that the phenotypic heterogeneity of these disorders is reflected in altered DNAm at specific sites. Further investigations of the DNAm sites associated with each disorder revealed that despite little overlap of these DNAm sites across the two disorders, both disorders were significantly enriched for mQTLs within our sample. CONCLUSIONS: Our DNAm data provide insights into the regulatory changes associated with genetic variation, highlighting their potential utility both in directing GWAS and in elucidating the pathophysiology of neurodevelopmental disorders.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.55

Children with progressive pLGG often require numerous treatment modalities including surgery, chemotherapy, rarely radiation therapy and, more recently, molecularly targeted therapy. We describe our institutional experience using the MEK inhibitor, trametinib, for recurrent/progressive pLGGs. METHODS: We performed a retrospective, IRB-approved, chart review of all pediatric patients treated with trametinib for recurrent/progressive pLGGs at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorder Center between 2016 and 2018. RESULTS: Eleven patients were identified, of which 10 were evaluable for response. Median age at commencement of trametinib treatment was 14.7 years (range 7.3-25.9 years). Tumor molecular status included KIAA1549-BRAF fusion (n = 4), NF1 mutation (n = 4), FGFR mutation (n = 1) and CDKN2A loss (n = 1). Median number of prior treatment regimens was 5 (range 1-12). Median duration of treatment with trametinib was 19.2 months (range 3.8-29.8 months). Based on modified RANO criteria, best responses included partial (n = 2), minor response (n = 2) and stable disease (n = 6). Two patients remain on therapy (29.8 and 25.9 months, respectively). The most common toxicities attributable to trametinib were rash, fatigue and gastrointestinal disturbance. Five patients required dose reduction for toxicities. Two patients experienced significant intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) while on trametinib. While it is unclear whether ICH was directly attributable to trametinib, therapy was discontinued. CONCLUSION: Trametinib appears to be an effective treatment for patients with recurrent/progressive pLGG. The toxicities of this therapy warrant further investigation, with particular attention to the potential risk for intracranial hemorrhage. Early phase multi-institutional clinical trials are underway.",Journal Article,,0.02

Yet little is known about their etiology, knowing which would aid in developing effective preventive measures. METHODS: Longitudinal assessments of disordered eating behaviors (DEBs)-binge-eating, purging, and dieting-and comorbid psychopathology were measured in 1386 adolescents from the IMAGEN study. Development of DEBs and associated mental health problems was investigated by comparing participants who reported symptoms at ages 16 or 19 years, but not at age 14 years, with asymptomatic control participants. Voxel-based morphometry and psychopathological differences at age 14 were investigated to identify risk factors for the development of DEBs and associated mental health problems. RESULTS: DEBs and depressive symptoms developed together. Emotional and behavioral problems, including symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder, predated their development. Alterations in frontostriatal brain areas also predated the development of DEBs and depressive symptoms. Specifically, development of binge-eating was predicted by higher gray matter volumes in the right putamen/globus pallidus at age 14. Conversely, development of purging and depressive symptoms was predicted by lower volumes in the medial orbitofrontal, dorsomedial, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices. Lower gray matter volumes in the orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices mediated the relationship between attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder symptoms and future purging and depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that alterations in frontal brain circuits are part of the shared etiology among eating disorders, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, conduct disorder, and depression and highlight the importance of a transdiagnostic approach to treating these conditions.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.57

We determined psychometric properties of the Walking Adaptability Ladder test for Kids (WAL-K) in 6-12 year old children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In total, 122 typically developing (TD) children and 26 children with Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD) completed the single and double run conditions of the WAL-K. Intra-rater, inter-rater and test-retest reliability were determined by ICCs and Smallest Detectable Change (SDC) in 53 TD children. Construct validity was determined by comparing WAL-K scores between 69 TD and all DCD children and correlating these scores with age and MABC-2 scores. RESULTS: ICCs for reliability varied between 0.76 and 0.99. Compared to the first test performance, WAL-K scores were lower (i.e., better) at retest. SDCs for test-retest reliability varied between 20.8 and 26.1% of the mean scores. WAL-K scores were significantly higher (i.e., worse) in DCD children compared to TD children (p < 0.001). Significant negative correlations were found with MABC-2 (-0.52 and -0.60) and age (-0.61 and -0.68). CONCLUSIONS: The WAL-K shows to be a valid, reliable and easy-to-use tool for measuring walking adaptability in children. Adding an extra practice trial may reduce the observed learning effect.Implications for rehabilitationWalking adaptability is an essential skill for children to participate in daily life, but no objective measurement tools are available.The Walking Adaptability Ladder test for Kids (WAL-K) is a new measurement tool for evaluating walking adaptability in children.The WAL-K shows to be a reliable and valid measurement tool for evaluating walking adaptability in 6-12 year old children.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.17

It is one of important factors contributing to non-adherence to medication that leads to increased hospitalization and higher healthcare costs. Hence, the study aimed to assess self-stigma and medication adherence among patients with mental illness treated at the psychiatric clinic of Jimma University Medical Center (JUMC). METHODS: A cross-sectional, community-level study was conducted at Jimma town. The patient's data was collected from records between April and June 2017 and the collected data was analyzed using SPSS version 21. The Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness (ISMI) tool was utilized to measure internalized stigma. Linear regression analysis was performed to get the final model. Statistical significance association was considered at p-values less than 0.05 and 95% confidence interval was used. RESULTS: Males comprised more than half (61%) of the total sample of 300 respondents and with a mean age of 34.99 (SD +/- 11.51) years. About one-third (32%) of patients had a working diagnosis of schizophrenia followed by major depressive disorder (24.3%). More than half of them, 182 (60.7%) were adherent to their psychotropic medication. The overall mean value of self-stigma was 2.16 (SD = 0.867) and 84 (28%) of the respondents had moderate to high self-stigma. Using ISMI the mean score of alienation was 2.26 (SD = 0.95), stereotype endorsement 2.14 (SD = 0.784), perceived discrimination 2.18 (SD = 0.90), social withdrawal 2.10 (SD = 0.857) and stigma resistance 2.11 (SD = 0.844). Increasing age of the patients (std. beta = - 0.091, p = 0.009) and living with kids and spouse (std. beta = - 0.099, p = 0.038) were negatively associated with self-stigma whereas increased world health organization disability assessment schedule (WHODAS) score (beta = 0.501, p < 0.001), number of relapses (std. beta = 0.183, p < 0.01) and medication non-adherence (std. beta = 0.084, p = 0.021) were positively associated with self-stigma. CONCLUSION: The study revealed that there was high self-stigma among patients with mental illness and a significant association between overall ISMI score and level of medication adherence. These require mental health professionals and policy-makers should give attention to ways to overcome self-stigma and increase medication adherence among patients with mental illness.",Journal Article,Competing interestsThe authors declare that they have no competing interests.,0.04

However, many neuroimaging studies of BD have been underpowered, leading to varied results and uncertainty regarding effects. The Enhancing Neuro Imaging Genetics through Meta-Analysis (ENIGMA) Bipolar Disorder Working Group was formed in 2012 to empower discoveries, generate consensus findings and inform future hypothesis-driven studies of BD. Through this effort, over 150 researchers from 20 countries and 55 institutions pool data and resources to produce the largest neuroimaging studies of BD ever conducted. The ENIGMA Bipolar Disorder Working Group applies standardized processing and analysis techniques to empower large-scale meta- and mega-analyses of multimodal brain MRI and improve the replicability of studies relating brain variation to clinical and genetic data. Initial BD Working Group studies reveal widespread patterns of lower cortical thickness, subcortical volume and disrupted white matter integrity associated with BD. Findings also include mapping brain alterations of common medications like lithium, symptom patterns and clinical risk profiles and have provided further insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms of BD. Here we discuss key findings from the BD working group, its ongoing projects and future directions for large-scale, collaborative studies of mental illness.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.0

Sleep problems may explain attentional lapses and inhibition performance variability in children with ADHD. This study applied Bayesian analyses to examine the relationship between ADHD symptoms, sleep problems, and inhibition. Methods: Participants included 73 children with ADHD and 73 non-ADHD controls, aged 10.5 to 13.5 years. The Stop Signal Task measured inhibition. Sleep problems were measured with the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale and parent-report. Results: ADHD symptoms are associated with sleep problems and reaction time variability, however, sleep problems accounted for more variance in inhibition performance than both hyperactive and inattentive symptoms. Conclusion: Sleep problems account for inhibition performance over and above ADHD symptom severity in children with and without ADHD diagnoses. This suggests clinical utility in assessing sleep in children with manifestations of ADHD, and interventions targeting sleep problems concurrently with behavioral symptoms. This further adds to the discussion on overdiagnosis of ADHD due to behavioral presentations of underlying sleep disorders. Treatment for phenotypes of ADHD could be enhanced by targeting sleep problems, in addition to inhibition deficits and attentional lapses.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.68

PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a phase 2a, flexible-dose, single-blind study, 41 male patients (aged 1855 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD (based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition) were titrated with centanafadine-SR 200300, 400, or 500 mg/d for 2 weeks, and then were treated with the titrated dose for 2 weeks. In a phase 2b, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 85 male and female patients (aged 1860 years) with a diagnosis of ADHD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition) were titrated to target doses of centanafadine-SR 400, 500, 600, or 800 mg/d over the course of 1 week, and then received their titrated dose for 3 weeks. The primary outcome in both studies was mean total ADHD Rating Scale-IV (ADHD-RS-IV) score. RESULTS: In the phase 2a study, mean ADHD-RS-IV total score decreased by 21.41 (standard deviation 10.74) from the start of active centanafadine-SR treatment to the end of week 4 (P<0.001). In the phase 2b study, centanafadine-SR treatment resulted in a statistically significant improvement in ADHD-RS-IV from baseline to week 3 compared with placebo (least-squares mean -16.5 vs -8.4; P<0.001; effect size 0.66), with significant efficacy demonstrated as early as week 1. Centanafadine-SR was generally well tolerated at doses </=400 mg. Most treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were mild or moderate; decreased appetite, headache, and nausea were the most frequently reported. In the 2 studies, 13 of 120 patients discontinued centanafadine-SR due to TEAEs; however, only 1 patient who received </=400 mg discontinued due to a TEAE. No serious TEAEs were reported at any dose.

There has been a dearth of qualitative studies exploring the behavioural phenotype from the perspective of caregivers raising children with FASD. The current study explores the cognitive and behavioural difficulties and impairments experienced by children with FASD aged between four and 12 years from the perspective of caregivers. METHODS: Fourteen caregivers of children with FASD participated in telephone interviews. Caregivers were recruited until data saturation occurred. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcribed interviews, using NVivo 12. RESULTS: Three over-arching themes were identified that consisted of subthemes 1) Self-regulation; behavioural, emotional, and attention; 2) Cognitive abilities; academic abilities and learning and memory; and 3) Adaptive functioning; social skills, communication and language skills, motor skills, and sleep concerns. Multiple subthemes were consistently identified across participants. A further two cross-cutting themes were identified; children behaving young for their age, and inconsistency in behaviour and strategies. DISCUSSION: Despite the lack of a consistent behavioural phenotype for FASD, the findings suggest consistency between caregivers in their reports of the difficulties experienced by children with FASD.

Sources of variability could arise from differences in measurement instruments as well as subgroup membership by severity of intellectual disability, gender and age. This systematic review aimed to address these gaps. METHOD: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched from inception to 2018 and selected studies were reviewed. Studies were included if they reported point prevalence estimates of mental health symptomology or diagnoses in a general population of 6- to 21-year-old individuals with intellectual disability. The Joanna Briggs Institute Prevalence Critical Appraisal Checklist was applied to eligible papers to appraise their scientific strength. Pooled prevalence for mental health symptomology was determined using a random-effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: A total of 19 studies were included, including 6151 children and adolescents. The pooled prevalence estimate captured by the Developmental Behaviour Checklist was 38% (95% confidence interval = [31, 46]), contrasting with 49% (95% confidence interval = [46, 51]) captured by the Child Behaviour Checklist; both rates were higher than a non-intellectual disability population. Severity of intellectual disability did not significantly influence the Developmental Behaviour Checklist risks. Insufficient data were available to conduct statistical analyses on the effects of age, gender and socioeconomic status. Of diagnosed psychiatric disorders, attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (30%), conduct disorder (3-21%) and anxiety disorders (7-34%) were the most prevalent conditions. CONCLUSION: This review consists of the largest sample hitherto evaluated. In the intellectual disability population, mental health comorbidities could be better detected by a symptom phenotype than a psychiatric diagnostic phenotype. Crucially, future research needs to address the effect of measurement validity in the intellectual disability population.

Previous studies have shown an elevated risk for neurobehavioral problems in individuals with SCT. However, not much is known about neurobehavioral problems in very young children; knowledge that could help with early identification of children at risk for suboptimal development, and that could help establish targets for early intervention. This study addressed the question of what the behavioral profile of children with SCT aged 1-5 years looks like. In total, 182 children aged 1-5 years participated in this study (NSCT =87, Nnonclinical controls = 95). Recruitment and assessment took place in the Netherlands and the United States. The SCT group was recruited through prospective follow-up (50%), information seeking parents (31%), and clinical referral (18%). Behavioral profiles were assessed with the child behavior checklist and the ages-and-stages social-emotional questionnaire. Levels of parent-rated problem behavior were higher in children with SCT. Difficulties with overall social-emotional functioning were already present in 1-year-olds, and elevated scores were persistent across the full age range. Affective and pervasive developmental behaviors were seen in late toddlerhood and prominent at preschool age. Anxiety, attention deficit, and oppositional defiant behaviors were seen in preschool-aged children. Within this cross-sectional study, the developmental trajectory of affective, pervasive developmental, and oppositional defiant behaviors seemed to be different for SCT children than nonclinical controls. Collectively, these results demonstrate the importance of behavioral screening for behavioral problems in routine clinical care for children with SCT from a young age. Social-emotional problems may require special attention, as these problems seem most prominent, showing increased risk across the full age range, and with these problems occurring regardless of the timing of diagnosis, and across all three SCT karyotypes.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.26

Two of the main shortcomings of the neuroimaging literature of these disorders are the small sample sizes employed and the heterogeneity of methods used. In 2013 and 2014, the ENIGMA-ADHD and ENIGMA-ASD working groups were respectively, founded with a common goal to address these limitations. Here, we provide a narrative review of the thus far completed and still ongoing projects of these working groups. Due to an implicitly hierarchical psychiatric diagnostic classification system, the fields of ADHD and ASD have developed largely in isolation, despite the considerable overlap in the occurrence of the disorders. The collaboration between the ENIGMA-ADHD and -ASD working groups seeks to bring the neuroimaging efforts of the two disorders closer together. The outcomes of case-control studies of subcortical and cortical structures showed that subcortical volumes are similarly affected in ASD and ADHD, albeit with small effect sizes. Cortical analyses identified unique differences in each disorder, but also considerable overlap between the two, specifically in cortical thickness. Ongoing work is examining alternative research questions, such as brain laterality, prediction of case-control status, and anatomical heterogeneity. In brief, great strides have been made toward fulfilling the aims of the ENIGMA collaborations, while new ideas and follow-up analyses continue that include more imaging modalities (diffusion MRI and resting-state functional MRI), collaborations with other large databases, and samples with dual diagnoses.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.62

We also examined whether processing speed predicted vocabulary and sentence-level abilities in receptive and expressive modalities. Method We examined processing speed in monolingual and bilingual school-age children (ages 8-12 years) with and without DLD. TD children (35 monolinguals, 24 bilinguals) and children with DLD (17 monolinguals, 10 bilinguals) completed a visual choice reaction time task. The Clinical Evaluation of Language Fundamentals, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, and the Expressive Vocabulary Test were used as language measures. Results The children with DLD exhibited slower response times relative to TD children. Response time was not modified by bilingual experience, neither in children with typical development nor children with DLD. Also, we found that faster processing speed was related to higher language abilities, but this relationship was not significant when socioeconomic status was controlled for. The magnitude of the association did not differ between the monolingual and bilingual groups across the language measures. Conclusions Slower processing speed is related to lower language abilities in children. Processing speed is minimally influenced by dual language experience, at least within this age range.

The authors sought to test whether the hypothesized cognitive and motivational pathways have separable neural correlates. METHODS: In a longitudinal community-based cohort of 1,963 adolescents, the neuroanatomical correlates of ADHD were identified by a voxel-wise association analysis and then validated using an independent clinical sample (99 never-medicated patients with ADHD, 56 medicated patients with ADHD, and 267 healthy control subjects). The cognitive and motivational pathways were assessed by neuropsychological tests of working memory, intrasubject variability, stop-signal reaction time, and delay discounting. The associations were tested between the identified neuroanatomical correlates and both ADHD symptoms 2 years later and the polygenic risk score for ADHD. RESULTS: Gray matter volumes of both a prefrontal cluster and a posterior occipital cluster were negatively associated with inattention. Compared with healthy control subjects, never-medicated patients, but not medicated patients, had significantly lower gray matter volumes in these two clusters. Working memory and intrasubject variability were associated with the posterior occipital cluster, and delay discounting was independently associated with both clusters. The baseline gray matter volume of the posterior occipital cluster predicted the inattention symptoms in a 2-year follow-up and was associated with the genetic risk for ADHD. CONCLUSIONS: The dual-pathway model has both shared and separable neuroanatomical correlates, and the shared correlate in the occipital cortex has the potential to serve as an imaging trait marker of ADHD, especially the inattention symptom domain.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.74

We aimed to define the neuropsychiatric profile associated with PCDH19 pathogenic variants and determine if a clinical profile exists for transmitting males. We also examined genotype- and phenotype-phenotype associations. We developed an online PCDH19 survey comprising the following standardized assessments: The Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function; the Social Responsiveness Scale, 2nd edition; the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire; and the Dimensional Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Genetic, seizure, and developmental information were also collected. The survey was completed by patients or by caregivers on behalf of patients. Of the 112 individuals represented (15 males), there were 70 unique variants. Thirty-five variants were novel and included a newly identified recurrent variant Ile781Asnfs*3. There were no significant differences in phenotypic outcomes between published and unpublished cases. Seizures occurred in clusters in 94% of individuals, with seizures resolving in 28% at an average age of 17.5 years. Developmental delay prior to seizure onset occurred in 18% of our cohort. Executive dysfunction and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) occurred in approximately 60% of individuals. The ASD profile included features of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. In addition, 21% of individuals met criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder that appeared to be distinct from ASD. There were no phenotypic differences between heterozygous females and mosaic males. We describe a mosaic male and two hemizygous males with atypical clinical profiles. Earlier seizure onset age and increased number of seizures within a cluster were associated with more severe ASD symptoms (p = 0.001), with seizure onset also predictive of executive dysfunction (p = 4.69 x 10(-4)) and prosocial behavior (p = 0.040). No clinical profile was observed for transmitting males. This is the first patient-derived standardized assessment of the neuropsychiatric profile of GCE.

Our study aimed to examine the underlying relationship between ASD and ADHD symptoms in a combined sample of children with a primary clinical diagnosis of ASD or ADHD. METHODS: Participants included children and youth (aged 3-20 years) with a clinical diagnosis of ASD (n = 303) or ADHD (n = 319) for a total of 622 participants. Parents of these children completed the social communication questionnaire (SCQ), a measure of autism symptoms, and the strengths and weaknesses of ADHD and normal behavior (SWAN) questionnaire, a measure of ADHD symptoms. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed on combined SCQ and SWAN items, followed by a profile analysis comparing normalized component scores between diagnostic groups and gender. RESULTS: PCA revealed a four-component solution (inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity, social-communication, and restricted, repetitive, behaviors, and interests (RRBI)), with no overlap between SCQ and SWAN items in the components. Children with ASD had higher component scores in social-communication and RRBI than children with ADHD, while there was no difference in inattentive and hyperactive/impulsive scores between diagnostic groups. Males had higher scores than females in social-communication, RRBI, and hyperactivity/impulsivity components in each diagnostic group. LIMITATIONS: We did not formally assess children with ASD for ADHD using our research-criteria for ADHD, and vice versa. High rates of co-occurring ADHD in ASD, for example, may have inflated component scores in inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity. A disadvantage with using single informant-based reports (i.e., parent-rated questionnaires) is that ASD and ADHD symptoms may be difficult to distinguish by parents, and may be interpreted differently between parents and clinicians. CONCLUSIONS: ASD and ADHD items loaded on separate components in our sample, suggesting that the measurement structure cannot explain the covariation between the two disorders in clinical samples. High levels of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were seen in both ASD and ADHD in our clinical sample. This supports the need for a dimensional framework that examines neurodevelopmental domains across traditional diagnostic boundaries. Females also had lower component scores across social-communication, RRBI, and hyperactivity/impulsivity than males, suggesting that there may be gender-specific phenotypes related to the two conditions.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.89

A key aspect of improving FASD diagnostic processes and management is understanding the demographic and neurocognitive profile of those living with FASD. The aim of this study was to describe the demographic and neurocognitive profile of the first 199 individuals diagnosed with FASD in PATCHES Paediatrics clinics. METHODS: A retrospective cross-sectional descriptive study design was conducted with individuals diagnosed with FASD between 2013 and 2018 through a multidisciplinary team according to the Australian FASD Diagnostic Guidelines. RESULTS: Participants were primarily male 133 (66.8%) and Aboriginal Australian 147 (73.9%), aged 2 to 31 (mean 10.5), with 94 (47.3%) from remote or very remote parts of Western Australia. Participants came from low 119 (59.8%), medium 48 (24.1%), and high 32 (16.1%) socioeconomic (SE) backgrounds. Low SE background was found to be a predictor of number of sentinel facial features (Wald chi(2) (1) = 4.03, p < 0.05). Most received a diagnosis of FASD with <3 sentinel features 165 (82.9%). Participants either had 6 or more 46 (23.1%), 5 44 (22.1%), 4 55 (27.6%), or 3 (27.1%) neurodevelopmental domains impaired. Executive functioning was the most commonly impaired neurodevelopmental domain 158 (79.4%), and 31 (61%) reported sleep disturbance. ADHD was the most observed comorbid condition (41.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This study improves our current understanding of neurocognitive and demographic profiles in individuals with FASD that have been clinically referred for diagnosis within Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and highlights the importance of prevention and early assessment/diagnosis as well as guidance regarding more targeted interventions. FASD affects individuals from all cultural and SE backgrounds. Individuals from middle to higher SE groups are at risk of FASD with prevention efforts needing to target these sectors of society.

While Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is not specifically related to distinct facial phenotypes, recent studies have suggested certain facial characteristics such as increased facial masculinity and asymmetry may be associated with ASD and its clinical presentations. In the present study, we conducted a preliminary investigation to examine facial morphology in autistic children with (n = 37; mean age = 8.21 years, SD = 2.72) and without (n = 100; mean age = 8.37 years, SD = 2.47) prenatal alcohol exposure. Using three-dimensional facial scans and principal component analysis, we identified a facial shape associated with prenatal alcohol exposure in autistic children. However, variations in the alcohol-related facial shape were generally not associated with behavioral and cognitive outcomes. These findings suggest that while early exposure to alcohol may influence the development of facial structures, it does not appear to be associated with ASD phenotypic variability. Importantly, although these findings do not implicate a role for prenatal alcohol exposure in the etiology of ASD, further research is warranted to investigate the link between prenatal alcohol exposure and facial morphology differences among neurodevelopmental conditions.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Declaration of competing interest All authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,0.0

The role of central nervous 5-HT function underlying these processes can be examined through serotonergic challenge methodologies. Acute tryptophan depletion (ATD) is a key challenge method whereby a diminished dietary intake of tryptophan-the amino acid precursor to brain 5-HT synthesis-results in temporary diminished central nervous 5-HT synthesis. While this particular methodology has been used in adult populations, it was only recently that modifications were made to enable the use of ATD in child and adolescent populations. Additionally, the Moja-De modification of the ATD challenge methodology has demonstrated benefits over other ATD techniques used previously. The aim of this protocol paper is to describe the ATD Moja-De methodology in detail, its benefits, as well as studies that have been conducted to validate the procedure in child and adolescent samples.

The aim of the study was to provide objective evidence as to which behavioural endpoint should be used in clinical trials. METHOD: Cross-sectional behavioural and demographic data were pooled from four paediatric NF1 tertiary referral centres in Australia and the United States (N=122; 65 males, 57 females; mean age [SD] 9y 2mo [3y], range 3-15y). RESULTS: Distributions of SRS-2 and SSIS-RS scores were unimodal and both yielded deficits, with a higher proportion of severely impaired scores on the SRS-2 (16.4%) compared to the SSIS-RS (8.2%). Pearson's product-moment correlations revealed that both questionnaires were highly related to each other (r=-0.72, p<0.001) and to measures of adaptive social functioning (both p<0.001). Both questionnaires were significantly related to attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, but only very weakly associated with intelligence. INTERPRETATION: The SRS-2 and SSIS-RS capture social dysfunction associated with NF1, suggesting both may be suitable choices for assessing social outcomes in this population in a clinical trial. However, careful thought needs to be given to the nature of the intervention when selecting either as a primary endpoint. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: The Social Responsiveness Scale, Second Edition yielded a large deficit relative to population norms. The Social Skills Improvement System - Rating Scales yielded a moderate deficit relative to population norms.

The purposes of this study were to examine how twinning effects influence the identification of children with language impairments at 4 and 6 years of age, comparing children with specific language impairment (SLI) and nonspecific language impairment (NLI); the likelihood that affectedness will be shared within monozygotic versus dizygotic twin pairs; and estimated levels of heritability for SLI and NLI. Twinning effects are predicted to result in elevated rates of language impairments in twins. Method The population-based twin sample included 1,354 children from 677 twin pairs, 214 monozygotic and 463 dizygotic, enrolled in a longitudinal study. Nine phenotypes from the same comprehensive direct behavioral assessment protocol were investigated at 4 and 6 years of age. Twinning effects were estimated for each phenotype at each age using structural equation models estimated via diagonally weighted least squares. Heritabilities were calculated for SLI and NLI. Results As predicted, the twinning effect increased the percentage of affected children in both groups across multiple language phenotypes, an effect that diminished with age yet was still not aligned to singleton age peers. Substantial heritability estimates replicated across language phenotypes and increased with age, even with the most lenient definition of affectedness, at -1 SD. Patterns of outcomes differed between SLI and NLI groups. Conclusions Nonverbal IQ is not on the same causal pathway as language impairments. Twinning effects on language acquisition affect classification of 4- and 6-year-old children as SLI and NLI, and heritability is most consistent in the SLI group. Clinical practice requires monitoring language acquisition of twins to avoid misdiagnosis when young or a missed diagnosis of language impairments at school entry.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Twin Study",,0.0

This study investigated normative ranges of HRQoL in children and explored its relationship with common pediatric concussion variables. Methods: A cross-sectional study of 1,722 non-concussed children 8-12 years old (M = 10.52 +/- 1.23 years; 1,335 males, 387 females) was conducted by secondary analysis of clinical baseline concussion data. Demographic information, concussion-like symptoms (PCSI-C), and HRQoL (KIDSCREEN-10 Index) were self-reported. Results: The most reported concussion-like symptoms were common stress symptoms and were significantly negatively correlated with HRQoL. Premorbid histories of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, mental health challenges, headaches/migraines, and concussion significantly lowered HRQoL. The number of diagnosed concussions and PCSI-C scores were significantly negatively correlated with HRQoL. Conclusions: The normative ranges and model can indicate HRQoL levels to inform clinicians how children may respond to concussion and streamline care beyond traditional assessment models.",Journal Article,,0.26

At the same time, neuroimaging studies of OCD have had notable limitations, including reliance on relatively small samples. International collaborative efforts to increase statistical power by combining samples from across sites have been bolstered by the ENIGMA consortium; this provides specific technical expertise for conducting multi-site analyses, as well as access to a collaborative community of neuroimaging scientists. In this article, we outline the background to, development of, and initial findings from ENIGMA's OCD working group, which currently consists of 47 samples from 34 institutes in 15 countries on 5 continents, with a total sample of 2,323 OCD patients and 2,325 healthy controls. Initial work has focused on studies of cortical thickness and subcortical volumes, structural connectivity, and brain lateralization in children, adolescents and adults with OCD, also including the study on the commonalities and distinctions across different neurodevelopment disorders. Additional work is ongoing, employing machine learning techniques. Findings to date have contributed to the development of neurobiological models of OCD, have provided an important model of global scientific collaboration, and have had a number of clinical implications. Importantly, our work has shed new light on questions about whether structural and functional alterations found in OCD reflect neurodevelopmental changes, effects of the disease process, or medication impacts. We conclude with a summary of ongoing work by ENIGMA-OCD, and a consideration of future directions for neuroimaging research on OCD within and beyond ENIGMA.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.0

The goal of evidence-based intervention and support is to alleviate distress, improve adaptation, and promote wellbeing. Support should be collaborative, with autistic individuals, families, and service providers taking a shared decision-making approach to maximise the individual's potential, minimise barriers, and optimise the person-environment fit. Comprehensive, naturalistic early intervention with active caregiver involvement can facilitate early social communication, adaptive functioning, and cognitive development; targeted intervention can help to enhance social skills and aspects of cognition. Augmentative and alternative communication interventions show preliminary evidence of benefit in minimising communication barriers. Co-occurring health issues, such as epilepsy and other neurodevelopmental disorders, sleep problems, and mental health challenges, should be treated in a timely fashion. The creation of autism-friendly contexts is best achieved by supporting families, reducing stigma, enhancing peer understanding, promoting inclusion in education, the community, and at work, and through advocacy.","Journal Article, Review",,0.0

STUDY DESIGN: Maternal body mass index (BMI) was calculated from prepregnancy height and weight provided in vital records or self-report at 4 months postpartum. Mothers reported paternal height and weight. At 7-8 years, mothers indicated if their children had been diagnosed with ADHD or anxiety (n = 1915). Additionally, children's behavior was measured with the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at 7 years of age (n = 1386) and the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale at 8 years of age (n = 1484). Based on Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire scores, we identified children with borderline behavioral problems. Adjusted risk ratios (aRR) and 95% CIs were estimated with robust multivariable Poisson regression. RESULTS: Compared with children of mothers with a BMI of <25, children whose mothers had BMI 25-30, 30-35, and >/=35 kg/m(2) had higher risks of reported ADHD (aRR, 1.14, 95% CI, 0.78-1.69; aRR, 1.96, 95% CI, 1.29-2.98; and aRR, 1.82, 95% CI,1.21-2.74, respectively). Risks of hyperactivity problems identified by the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and a positive screen for inattentive or hyperactive/impulsive behavior with the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Parent Rating Scale were also higher with increasing maternal prepregnancy BMI. Paternal BMI was not associated with child outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that maternal, rather than paternal, obesity is associated with maternal report of child ADHD diagnosis and inattentive or hyperactivity problems. Further research is needed to understand how maternal obesity might influence these behavioral changes during or after pregnancy.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural",,0.55

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2018 has identified 1 in 59 children (1 in 37 boys and 1 in 151 girls) has autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Autistic spectrum disorders and ADHD are complex conditions in which nutritional and environmental factors play major roles. It is important to understand how food can have an impact on their current and future health. Appealing food colors stimulate the consumption of different food products. Since 2011, it is evident that dyes are linked to harmful effects in children. Artificial dyes have neurotoxic chemicals that aggravate mental health problems. Many families with autistic children avoid food dyes in their diet in order to avoid behavioral issues. A study reported that there is a correlation between yellow dye and sleep disturbance. Food colors Blue 1 and 2, Green 3, Red 3, Yellow 5 and 6, Citrus Red 2, and Red 40 can trigger many behaviors in most kids. Artificial food color usually contains petroleum and is manufactured in a chemical process that includes formaldehyde, aniline, hydroxides, and sulfuric acids. Most impurities in the food color are in the form of salts or acids. Sometimes lead, arsenic, and mercury may be present as impurities. The U.S. FDA is yet to study the effects of synthetic dyes on behavior in children. A study conducted at Southampton University in England found a link between food dyes and hyperactive behavior in children. The research does not prove that food coloring actually causes autism spectrum disorder, but there seems to be a link. This chapter attempts to provide a broad review of the available literature on food color and the epidemiology, etiology, prevention, and treatment of autistic spectrum disorder.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis",,0.3

The objectives of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to systematically review the prevalence of psychiatric disorders and symptoms in children and adolescents with these disorders and compare phenotypic signatures between syndromes. METHOD: MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases were searched for articles from study inception to December 2018. Eligible articles were peer reviewed, were published in English, and reported prevalence data for psychiatric disorders and symptoms in children and adolescents aged 4 to 21 years using a formal psychiatric assessment or a standardized assessment of mental health symptoms. Pooled prevalence was determined using a random-effects meta-analysis in studies with sufficient data. Prevalence estimates were compared with general population data using a test of binomial proportions. RESULTS: Of 2,301 studies identified for review, 39 articles were included in the final pool, which provided data on 4,039 children and adolescents. Ten syndromes were represented, and five were predominant: Down syndrome, 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, fragile X syndrome, Williams syndrome, and Prader-Willi syndrome. The Child Behavior Checklist was the most commonly used assessment tool for psychiatric symptoms. The pooled prevalence with total scores above the clinical threshold was lowest for Down syndrome (32% [95% confidence interval, 19%-44%]) and highest for Prader-Willi syndrome (74% [95% CI, 65%-82%]) with each syndrome associated with significantly higher prevalence than in the general population. Parallel trends were observed for the internalizing and externalizing domains and social subscale scores. CONCLUSION: Differential vulnerability for psychiatric phenotype expression across the disorders was observed. Syndromes with higher levels of social ability or competence appear to offer relative protection against developing psychopathology. This preliminary finding merits further exploration.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review, Systematic Review",,0.0

However, translation from preclinical models to human clinical trials has proven challenging. Poor reproducibility of cognitive endpoints may provide one explanation for this finding. We examined the suitability of cognitive outcomes for clinical trials in children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) by examining test-retest reliability of the measures and the application of data reduction techniques to improve reproducibility. METHODS: Data were analyzed from the STARS clinical trial (n = 146), a multi-center double-blind placebo-controlled phase II trial of lovastatin, conducted by the NF Clinical Trials Consortium. Intra-class correlation coefficients were generated between pre- and post-performances (16-week interval) on neuropsychological endpoints in the placebo group to determine test-retest reliabilities. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to reduce data into cognitive domains and account for measurement error. RESULTS: Test-retest reliabilities were highly variable, with most endpoints demonstrating unacceptably low reproducibility. Data reduction confirmed four distinct neuropsychological domains: executive functioning/attention, visuospatial ability, memory, and behavior. Test-retest reliabilities of latent factors improved to acceptable levels for clinical trials. Applicability and utility of our model was demonstrated by homogeneous effect sizes in the reanalyzed efficacy data. INTERPRETATION: These data demonstrate that single observed endpoints are not appropriate to determine efficacy, partly accounting for the poor test-retest reliability of cognitive outcomes in clinical trials in neurodevelopmental disorders. Recommendations to improve reproducibility are outlined to guide future trial design.","Clinical Trial, Phase II, Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,0.02

Black children had the highest neighborhood disorganization scores compared with other racial/ethnic categories. However, Black children had the lowest proportion of mental health diagnoses. Lower neighborhood disorganization was associated with having a mental health diagnosis; however, when adding race/ethnicity to the model, neighborhood disorganization no longer was significant. Conclusions: Level of neighborhood disorganization was highly correlated with racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhoods, and Black children disproportionately resided in highly disorganized neighborhoods compared with other groups.

Anxiety in children with ADHD has been shown to be associated with poorer child and family functioning. Small pilot studies suggest that treating anxiety in children with ADHD using cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) has promising benefits. In a fully powered randomized controlled trial (RCT), we aim to investigate the efficacy of an existing CBT intervention adapted for children with ADHD and comorbid anxiety compared with usual care. METHODS: This RCT is recruiting children aged 8-12 years (N = 228) from pediatrician practices in Victoria, Australia. Eligibility criteria include meeting full diagnostic criteria for ADHD and at least one anxiety disorder (Generalized, Separation or Social). Eligible children are randomized to receive a 10 session CBT intervention (Cool Kids) versus usual clinical care from their pediatrician. The intervention focuses on building child and parent skills and strategies to manage anxiety and associated impairments including cognitive restructuring and graded exposure. Minor adaptations have been made to the delivery of the intervention to meet the needs of children with ADHD including increased use of visual materials and breaks between activities. The primary outcome is change in the proportion of children meeting diagnostic criteria for an anxiety disorder at 5 months randomization. This will be assessed via diagnostic interview with the child's parent (Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for Children V) conducted by a researcher blinded to intervention condition. Secondary outcomes include a range of child (e.g., anxiety symptoms, ADHD severity, behavior, quality of life, sleep, cognitive functioning, school attendance) and parent (e.g., mental health, parenting behaviors, work attendance) domains of functioning assessed at 5 and 12 months post-randomization. Outcomes will be analyzed using logistic and mixed effects regression. DISCUSSION: The results from this study will provide evidence on whether treating comorbid anxiety in children with ADHD using a CBT approach leads to improvements in anxiety and/or broader functional outcomes.

Objective: To determine the association of the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 deletion and duplication CNVs with cortical and subcortical brain morphology and cognitive task performance. Design, Setting, and Participants: In this genetic association study, T1-weighted brain magnetic resonance imaging were combined with genetic data from the ENIGMA-CNV consortium and the UK Biobank, with a replication cohort from Iceland. In total, 203 deletion carriers, 45 247 noncarriers, and 306 duplication carriers were included. Data were collected from August 2015 to April 2019, and data were analyzed from September 2018 to September 2019. Main Outcomes and Measures: The associations of the CNV with global and regional measures of surface area and cortical thickness as well as subcortical volumes were investigated, correcting for age, age2, sex, scanner, and intracranial volume. Additionally, measures of cognitive ability were analyzed in the full UK Biobank cohort. Results: Of 45756 included individuals, the mean (SD) age was 55.8 (18.3) years, and 23754 (51.9%) were female. Compared with noncarriers, deletion carriers had a lower surface area (Cohen d = -0.41; SE, 0.08; P = 4.9 x 10-8), thicker cortex (Cohen d = 0.36; SE, 0.07; P = 1.3 x 10-7), and a smaller nucleus accumbens (Cohen d = -0.27; SE, 0.07; P = 7.3 x 10-5). There was also a significant negative dose response on cortical thickness (beta = -0.24; SE, 0.05; P = 6.8 x 10-7). Regional cortical analyses showed a localization of the effects to the frontal, cingulate, and parietal lobes. Further, cognitive ability was lower for deletion carriers compared with noncarriers on 5 of 7 tasks. Conclusions and Relevance: These findings, from the largest CNV neuroimaging study to date, provide evidence that 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 structural variation is associated with brain morphology and cognition, with deletion carriers being particularly affected. The pattern of results fits with known molecular functions of genes in the 15q11.2 BP1-BP2 region and suggests involvement of these genes in neuronal plasticity. These neurobiological effects likely contribute to the association of this CNV with neurodevelopmental disorders.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

METHODS: A secondary analysis was conducted on data obtained from the Canadian component of the World Health Organization International Study on the Prevalence of FASD. Data on neurodevelopmental status and behavior were derived from a battery of standardized tests and the Child Behavior Checklist for 21 children with FASD, 28 children with other neurodevelopmental disorders, and 37 typically developing control children, aged 7 to 11 years. Two latent profile analyses were performed to derive discriminative profiles: i) children with FASD compared with typically developing control children, and ii) children with FASD compared with typically developing control children and children with other neurodevelopmental disorders. The classification function of the resulting profiles was evaluated using the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). Confidence intervals (CIs) were approximated using 10,000 bootstrapped samples. RESULTS: The neurodevelopmental profile of FASD tested consisted of impairments in perceptual reasoning, verbal comprehension, visual-motor speed and motor coordination, processing speed (nonverbal information), attention and executive function, visuospatial processing, and language, in combination with rule-breaking behavior and attention problems. When children with FASD were compared with typically developing control children, a 2-class model fit the data best and resulted in a sensitivity of 95.2% (95% CI: 84.2-100.0%), specificity of 89.2% (95% CI: 78.4-97.5%), PPV of 83.3% (95% CI: 66.7-96.2%), and NPV of 97.1% (95% CI: 90.3-100.0%). When children with FASD were compared with typically developing control children and children with other neurodevelopmental disorders, the neurodevelopmental profile correctly identified only 56.9% (95% CI: 45.1-69.2%) of typically developing children and children with other neurodevelopmental disorders as not having FASD, and thus the profile was found not to be specific to children with FASD. CONCLUSION: The findings question the uniqueness of children with FASD with respect to their neurodevelopmental impairments and behavioral manifestations.",Journal Article,,0.11

Method We examined the attentional networks in monolingual and bilingual school-aged children (ages 8-12 years) with and without DLD. TD children (35 monolinguals, 23 bilinguals) and children with DLD (17 monolinguals, 9 bilinguals) completed the Attention Network Test (Fan et al., 2002; Fan, McCandliss, Fossella, Flombaum, & Posner, 2005). Results Children with DLD exhibited poorer executive control than TD children, but executive control was not modified by bilingual experience. The bilingual group with DLD and both TD groups exhibited an orienting effect, but the monolingual group with DLD did not. No group differences were found for alerting. Conclusions Children with DLD have weak executive control skills. These skills are minimally influenced by dual language experience, at least in this age range. A potential bilingual advantage in orienting may be present in the DLD group.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.15

In Australia, the prevalence of FASD is unknown; however, two studies have revealed the prevalence of FASD in high risk populations in Western Australia. Individuals with FASD may experience higher rates of negative outcomes including poor school performance, involvement with the justice system and incarceration, substance use and are at risk of being placed in out-of-home care. Caregivers of children with FASD can experience challenges and high levels of stress due to the disruptive behaviours displayed by many children diagnosed with FASD. Whilst experiences of caregivers raising children with FASD have been documented globally, little is known about the experiences of caregivers in a remote Australian context, particularly from an Australian Aboriginal perspective. This study aimed to investigate the experiences of caregivers in a remote Australian context. The findings will be valuable to inform programs at the family, community and broader policy levels that can help enhance children's development and wellbeing. METHODS: Participants (n=7) in this qualitative study were recruited through a FASD diagnostic clinic and family support organisation in the Port Hedland region of Western Australia. Eligible participants were previous or current caregivers of children with a FASD diagnosis or risk of FASD and provided informed consent before participating in semi-structured interviews using a phenomenological approach. The interviews were 30-60 minutes in duration and were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim using NVivo 11 computer software, with all identifying information removed. RESULTS: The caregivers provided rich, descriptive narratives revealing the challenges and stress they experienced when they first started caring for their child with FASD. Caregivers articulated how they developed and adapted strategies through trial and error that enabled them to better manage disruptive behaviours and maintain a stable, calm environment. A thematic analysis revealed four major themes: the importance of routine and structure for the child and family, the importance of family support, the benefits of peer support groups and various social issues impacting children's development. Maintaining routine and structure had helped many caregivers mitigate stress and reduce disruptive behaviours, and family support allowed caregivers some respite whilst ensuring children remained connected to their biological families and culture. The caregivers also shared that peer support groups would be beneficial to share stories and strategies with others experiencing similar circumstances. Broader societal issues requiring attention at the community level were discussed, in addition to caregivers having awareness of the complexities impacting the children's biological families. CONCLUSION: The caregivers in this study have gained valuable knowledge and wisdom through caring for a child with FASD that can benefit health professionals and the broader community. Whilst the caregivers in this study have overcome challenges through developing and adapting their own strategies, support services providing tailored programs for caregivers when they first start caring for a child with FASD would be beneficial. Furthermore, formal respite was not utilised by the caregivers in this study due to safety issues, inconsistent parenting and interrupted routines, therefore investigation into training respite caregivers in the area of FASD would be beneficial. Furthermore, respite services should consider provisions to include extended families and kinship relationships in a formal context to enable ongoing cultural and family connection, consistent parenting strategies and routines.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

Using microarray (Affymetrix CytoScan HD), we genotyped 2,691 subjects diagnosed with an NDD (204 SCZ, 1,838 ASD, 427 ADHD and 222 OCD) and 1,769 family members, mainly parents. We identified rare CNVs, defined as those found in <0.1% of 10,851 population control samples. We found clinically relevant CNVs (broadly defined) in 284 (10.5%) of total subjects, including 22 (10.8%) among subjects with SCZ, 209 (11.4%) with ASD, 40 (9.4%) with ADHD, and 13 (5.6%) with OCD. Among all NDD subjects, we identified 17 (0.63%) with aneuploidies and 115 (4.3%) with known genomic disorder variants. We searched further for genes impacted by different CNVs in multiple disorders. Examples of NDD-associated genes linked across more than one disorder (listed in order of occurrence frequency) are NRXN1, SEH1L, LDLRAD4, GNAL, GNG13, MKRN1, DCTN2, KNDC1, PCMTD2, KIF5A, SYNM, and long non-coding RNAs: AK127244 and PTCHD1-AS.

In spine surgery, adolescents with scoliosis are a population particularly at risk for depression, anxious feelings, and impaired quality of life related to back pain and cosmetic appearance of the deformity. With the rising prevalence of mental health ailments, it is necessary to evaluate the impact of concurrent affective disorders on patient care after spinal surgery in adolescents. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact that affective disorders have on perioperative complication rates, length of stay (LOS), and total costs in adolescents undergoing elective posterior spinal fusion (PSF) (>/= 4 levels) for idiopathic scoliosis. METHODS: A retrospective study of the Kids' Inpatient Database for the year 2012 was performed. Adolescent patients (age range 10-17 years old) with AIS undergoing elective PSF (>/= 4 levels) were selected using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification coding system. Patients were categorized into 2 groups at discharge: affective disorder or no affective disorder. Patient demographics, comorbidities, complications, LOS, discharge disposition, and total cost were assessed. The primary outcomes were perioperative complication rates, LOS, total cost, and discharge dispositions. RESULTS: There were 3759 adolescents included in this study, of whom 164 (4.4%) were identified with an affective disorder (no affective disorder: n = 3595). Adolescents with affective disorders were significantly older than adolescents with no affective disorders (affective disorder: 14.4 +/- 1.9 years vs no affective disorder: 13.9 +/- 1.8 years, p = 0.001), and had significantly different proportions of race (p = 0.005). Aside from hospital region (p = 0.016), no other patient- or hospital-level factors differed between the cohorts. Patient comorbidities did not differ significantly between cohorts. The number of vertebral levels involved was similar between the cohorts, with the majority of patients having 9 or more levels involved (affective disorder: 76.8% vs no affective disorder: 79.5%, p = 0.403). Postoperative complications were similar between the cohorts, with no significant difference in the proportion of patients experiencing a postoperative complication (p = 0.079) or number of complications (p = 0.124). The mean length of stay and mean total cost were similar between the cohorts. Moreover, the routine and nonroutine discharge dispositions were also similar between the cohorts, with the majority of patients having routine discharges (affective disorder: 93.9% vs no affective disorder: 94.9%, p = 0.591). CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that affective disorders may not have a significant impact on surgical outcomes in adolescent patients undergoing surgery for scoliosis in comparison with adults. Further studies are necessary to elucidate how affective disorders affect adolescent patients with idiopathic scoliosis, which may improve provider approach in managing these patients perioperatively and at follow-up in hopes to better the overall patient satisfaction and quality of care delivered.",Journal Article,,0.3

It is of interest to understand if this phenotype stems from some shared neurobiology. METHODS: To investigate this possibility, we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) neuroimaging to compare brain activity in children (n = 88; 8-15 years) with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as they completed a set-shifting/mental flexibility task. RESULTS: Neuroimaging results revealed a similar parietal activation profile across the NDD, groups suggesting a link to their shared phenotype. Differences in frontal activity differentiated the three clinical groups. Brain-behaviour analyses showed a link with repetitive behaviours suggesting shared dysfunction in the associative loop of the corticostriatal system. CONCLUSION: Our study supports the notion that NDDs may exist along a complex phenotypic/biological continuum. All NDD groups showed a sustained parietal activity profile suggesting that they share a strong reliance on the posterior parietal cortices to complete the mental flexibility task; future studies could elucidate whether this is due to delayed brain development or compensatory functioning. The differences in frontal activity may play a role in differentiating the NDDs. The OCD group showed sustained prefrontal activity that may be reflective of hyperfrontality. The ASD group showed reduced frontal activation suggestive of frontal dysfunction and the ADHD group showed an extensive hypoactivity that included frontal and parietal regions. Brain-behaviour analyses showed a significant correlation with repetitive behaviours which may reflect dysfunction in the associative loop of the corticostriatal system, linked to inflexible behaviours.","Comparative Study, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.36

Deviations in structural and functional neural connectivity are highly implicated in both TSC and ASD. For the first time, we explore whether electroencephalographic (EEG) measures of neural network function precede or predict the emergence of ASD in TSC. We determine whether altered brain function (a) is present in infancy in TSC, (b) differentiates infants with TSC based on ASD diagnostic status, and (c) is associated with later cognitive function. We studied 35 infants with TSC (N = 35), and a group of typically developing infants (N = 20) at 12 and 24 months of age. Infants with TSC were later subdivided into ASD and non-ASD groups based on clinical evaluation. We measured features of spontaneous alpha oscillations (6-12 Hz) that are closely associated with neural network development: alpha power, alpha phase coherence (APC), and peak alpha frequency (PAF). Infants with TSC demonstrated reduced interhemispheric APC compared to controls at 12 months of age, and these differences were found to be most pronounced at 24 months in the infants who later developed ASD. Across all infants, PAF at 24 months was associated with verbal and nonverbal cognition at 36 months. Associations between early network function and later neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes highlight the potential utility of early scalable EEG markers to identify infants with TSC requiring additional targeted intervention initiated very early in life. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1758-1773. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Approximately half of infants with tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) develop autism. Here, using EEG, we find that there is a reduction in communication between brain regions during infancy in TSC, and that the infants who show the largest reductions are those who later develop autism. Being able to identify infants who show early signs of disrupted brain development may improve the timing of early prediction and interventions in TSC, and also help us to understand how early brain changes lead to autism.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,0.0

Different treatment strategies for hydrocephalus characteristically result in different effects on the size of the ventricles. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this systematic review was to determine whether persistent ventricular enlargement adversely impacts neurocognitive development in patients with MM. METHODS: The PubMed National Library of Medicine Medline database and Embase were queried using MeSH headings and keywords relevant to neurocognitive or intellectual development and ventricular size or morphology. Abstracts were reviewed by the authors to identify which studies met strict inclusion criteria. An evidence table was constructed that summarized the included studies and reflected the quality of evidence (Classes I-III) that each represented. A recommendation was made that is based on the quality of the evidence. RESULTS: An initial abstract review utilizing strict inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded 48 studies, 9 of which underwent full-text review. There is limited and conflicting Class III evidence from 2 studies. CONCLUSION: Currently, there is insufficient data to conclude that ventricular size and morphology impact neurocognitive development.The full guideline can be found at https://www.cns.org/guidelines/guidelines-spina-bifida-chapter-5.","Journal Article, Practice Guideline, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Systematic Review",,0.0

Despite this, it does not receive the same attention as other chronic pulmonary conditions in children such as cystic fibrosis. We measured health resource use and health-related quality of life over a 12-month period in children with bronchiectasis. METHODS: We undertook a prospective cohort study of 85 children aged < 18-years with high-resolution chest computed-tomography confirmed bronchiectasis undergoing management in three pediatric respiratory medical clinics in Darwin and Brisbane, Australia and Auckland, New Zealand. Children with cystic fibrosis or receiving cancer treatment were excluded. Data collected included the frequency of healthcare attendances (general practice, specialists, hospital and/or emergency departments, and other), medication use, work and school/childcare absences for parents/carers and children respectively, and both parent/carer and child reported quality of life and cough severity. RESULTS: Overall, 951 child-months of observation were completed for 85 children (median age 8.7-years, interquartile range 5.4-11.3). The mean (standard deviation) number of exacerbations was 3.3 (2.2) per child-year. Thirty of 264 (11.4%) exacerbation episodes required hospitalization. Healthcare attendance and antibiotic use rates were high (30 and 50 per 100 child-months of observation respectively). A carer took leave from work for 53/236 (22.5%) routine clinic visits. Absences from school/childcare due to bronchiectasis were 24.9 children per 100 child-months. Quality of life scores for both the parent/carer and child were highly-correlated with one another, remained stable over time and were negatively associated with cough severity. CONCLUSIONS: Health resource use in this cohort of children is high, reflecting their severe disease burden. Studies are now needed to quantify the direct and societal costs of disease and to evaluate interventions that may reduce disease burden, particularly hospitalizations.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study",,0.02

This study aimed to determine mediators and moderators of the relative treatment efficacy of ConquerFear versus relaxation. METHODS: One hundred and fifty-two cancer survivors completed 5 therapy sessions and outcome measures before and after intervention and at 6 months' follow-up. We examined theoretically relevant variables as potential mediators and moderators of treatment outcome. We hypothesized that metacognitions and intrusions would moderate and mediate the relationship between treatment group and FCR level at follow-up. RESULTS: Only total FCR score at baseline moderated treatment outcome. Participants with higher levels of FCR benefited more from ConquerFear relative to relaxation on the primary outcome. Changes in metacognitions and intrusive thoughts about cancer during treatment partially mediated the relationship between treatment group and FCR. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that ConquerFear is relatively more effective than relaxation for those with overall higher levels of FCR. The mediation analyses confirmed that the most likely mechanism of treatment efficacy was the reduction in unhelpful metacognitions and intrusive thoughts during treatment, consistent with the theoretical framework underpinning ConquerFear. IMPLICATIONS FOR CANCER SURVIVORS: ConquerFear is a brief, effective treatment for FCR in cancer survivors with early-stage disease. The treatment works by reducing intrusive thoughts about cancer and changing beliefs about worry and is particularly helpful for people with moderate to severe FCR.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Randomized Controlled Trial",,0.09

We aimed to test the efficacy of a pre-emptive intervention designed for infants showing early behavioural signs of autism spectrum disorder. METHODS: In this single-blind, randomised controlled trial done at two specialist centres in Australia, infants aged 9-14 months were enrolled if they were showing at least three early behavioural signs of autism spectrum disorder on the Social Attention and Communication Surveillance-Revised (SACS-R) 12-month checklist. Infants were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive a parent-mediated video-aided intervention (iBASIS-VIPP) or treatment as usual. Group allocation was done by minimisation, stratified by site, sex, age, and the number of SACS-R risk behaviours. Assessments were done at baseline (before treatment allocation) and at the 6 month endpoint. The primary outcome was Autism Observation Scale for Infants (AOSI), which measures early behavioural signs associated with autism spectrum disorder. Secondary outcomes were a range of infant and caregiver outcomes measured by Manchester Assessment of Caregiver-Infant interaction (MACI), Mullen Scales of Early Learning (MSEL), Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales, 2nd edition (VABS-2), MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI), and Parenting Sense of Competence (PSOC) scale. This trial is registered with Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, number ANZCTR12616000819426. FINDINGS: Between June 9, 2016, and March 30, 2018, 103 infants were randomly assigned, 50 to the iBASIS-VIPP group and 53 to the treatment-as-usual group. After the intervention, we observed no significant differences between groups on early autism spectrum disorder behavioural signs measured by the AOSI (difference estimate -0.74, 95% CI -2.47 to 0.98). We also observed no significant differences on secondary outcomes measuring caregiver non-directiveness (0.16, -0.33 to 0.65), caregiver sensitive responding (0.24, -0.15 to 0.63), and infant attentiveness (-0.19, -0.63 to 0.25) during parent-child interactions (MACI), as well as on researcher-administered measures of receptive (1.30, -0.48 to 3.08) and expressive language (0.54, -0.73 to 1.80), visual reception (0.31, -0.77 to 1.40), and fine motor skills (0.55, -0.32 to 1.41) using the MSEL. Compared with the treatment-as-usual group, the iBASIS-VIPP group had lower infant positive affect (-0.69, -1.27 to -0.10) on the MACI, but higher caregiver-reported receptive (37.17, 95% CI 10.59 to 63.75) and expressive vocabulary count (incidence rate ratio 2.31, 95% CI 1.22 to 4.33) on MCDI, and functional language use (difference estimate 6.43, 95% CI 1.06 to 11.81) on VABS. There were no significant group differences on caregiver-reported measures of MCDI infant gesture use (3.22, -0.60 to 7.04) and VABS social behaviour (3.28, -1.43 to 7.99). We observed no significant differences between groups on self-reported levels of parenting satisfaction (difference estimate 0.21, 95% CI -0.09 to 0.52), interest (-0.23, -0.62 to 0.16) and efficacy (-0.08, -0.38 to 0.22) on PSOC. INTERPRETATION: A pre-emptive intervention for the autism spectrum disorder prodrome had no immediate treatment effect on early autism spectrum disorder symptoms, the quality of parent-child interactions, or researcher-administered measures of developmental skills. However, we found a positive effect on parent-rated infant communication skills. Ongoing follow-up of this infant cohort will assess longer-term developmental effects.

One physical marker that has received increasing research attention is facial structure. Although there remains little consensus in the field, findings relating to greater facial asymmetry (FA) in ASC exhibit some consistency. As there is growing recognition of the importance of replicatory studies in ASC research, the aim of this study was to investigate the replicability of increased FA in autistic children compared to nonautistic peers. Using three-dimensional photogrammetry, this study examined FA in 84 autistic children, 110 typically developing children with no family history of the condition, and 49 full siblings of autistic children. In support of previous literature, significantly greater depth-wise FA was identified in autistic children relative to the two comparison groups. As a further investigation, increased lateral FA in autistic children was found to be associated with greater severity of ASC symptoms on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, second edition, specifically related to repetitive and restrictive behaviors. These outcomes provide an important and independent replication of increased FA in ASC, as well as a novel contribution to the field. Having confirmed the direction and areas of increased FA in ASC, these findings could motivate a search for potential underlying brain dysmorphogenesis. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1774-1783. (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: This study looked at the amount of facial asymmetry (FA) in autistic children compared to typically developing children and children who have siblings with autism. The study found that autistic children, compared to the other two groups, had greater FA, and that increased FA was related to greater severity of autistic symptoms. The face and brain grow together during the earliest stages of development, and so findings of facial differences in autism might inform future studies of early brain differences associated with the condition.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

Over time, this term has become synonymous with expectations of greater functional skills and better long-term outcomes, despite contradictory clinical observations. This study investigated the relationship between adaptive behaviour, cognitive estimates (intelligence quotient) and age at diagnosis in autism spectrum disorder. Participants (n = 2225, 1-18 years of age) were notified at diagnosis to a prospective register and grouped by presence (n = 1041) or absence (n = 1184) of intellectual disability. Functional abilities were reported using the Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales. Regression models suggested that intelligence quotient was a weak predictor of Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales after controlling for sex. Whereas the intellectual disability group's adaptive behaviour estimates were close to reported intelligence quotients, Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales scores fell significantly below intelligence quotients for children without intellectual disability. The gap between intelligence quotient and Vineland Adaptive Behaviour Scales scores remained large with increasing age at diagnosis for all children. These data indicate that estimates from intelligence quotient alone are an imprecise proxy for functional abilities when diagnosing autism spectrum disorder, particularly for those without intellectual disability. We argue that 'high functioning autism' is an inaccurate clinical descriptor when based solely on intelligence quotient demarcations and this term should be abandoned in research and clinical practice.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

This disorder is a relatively common genetic cause of early-life epilepsy. A specific severity assessment is lacking, required to monitor the clinical course and needed to define the natural history and for clinical trial readiness. METHODS: A severity assessment was developed based on clinical and research experience from the International Foundation for CDKL5 Research Centers of Excellence consortium and the National Institutes of Health Rett and Rett-Related Disorders Natural History Study consortium. An initial draft severity assessment was presented and reviewed at the annual CDKL5 Forum meeting (Boston, 2017). Subsequently it was iterated through four cycles of a modified Delphi process by a group of clinicians, researchers, industry, patient advisory groups, and parents familiar with this disorder until consensus was achieved. The revised version of the severity assessment was presented for review, comment, and piloting to families at the International Foundation for CDKL5 Research-sponsored family meeting (Colorado, 2018). Final revisions were based on this additional input. RESULTS: The final severity assessment comprised 51 items that comprehensively describe domains of epilepsy; motor; cognition, behavior, vision, and speech; and autonomic functions. Parental ratings of therapy effectiveness and child and family functioning are also included. CONCLUSIONS: A severity assessment was rapidly developed with input from multiple stakeholders. Refinement through ongoing validation is required for future clinical trials. The consensus methods employed for the development of severity assessment may be applicable to similar rare disorders.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.0

The major aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of diagnostic and therapeutic interventions on cognitive outcomes in UCDs. METHODS: This prospective, observational, multicenter study includes data from 503 individuals with UCDs who had comprehensive neurocognitive testing with a cumulative follow-up of 702 patient-years. RESULTS: The mean cognitive standard deviation score (cSDS) was lower in symptomatic than in asymptomatic (p < 0.001, t test) individuals with UCDs. Intellectual disability (intellectual quotient < 70, cSDS < -2.0) was associated with the respective subtype of UCD and early disease onset, whereas height of the initial peak plasma ammonium concentration was inversely associated with neurocognitive outcomes in mitochondrial (proximal) rather than cytosolic (distal) UCDs. In ornithine transcarbamylase and argininosuccinate synthetase 1 deficiencies, we did not find evidence that monoscavenger therapy with sodium or glycerol phenylbutyrate was superior to sodium benzoate in providing cognitive protection. Early liver transplantation appears to be beneficial for UCDs. It is noteworthy that individuals with argininosuccinate synthetase 1 and argininosuccinate lyase deficiencies identified by newborn screening had better neurocognitive outcomes than those diagnosed after the manifestation of first symptoms. INTERPRETATION: Cognitive function is related to interventional and non-interventional variables. Early detection by newborn screening and early liver transplantation appear to offer greater cognitive protection, but none of the currently used nitrogen scavengers was superior with regard to long-term neurocognitive outcome.

METHODS: Despite sharing the mutation in the Huntingtin gene, adult-onset HD characteristically presents as a hyperkinetic motor disorder, while JOHD typically presents as a hypokinetic motor disease. The University of Iowa Kids-JHD program enrolls individuals 5 to 25 years of age who have already received the clinical diagnosis. A total of 19 children with juvenile HD (JHD) (mean CAG = 72) were studied. Patients with JHD were compared to healthy controls (n = 234) using a cross-sectional study design. Volumetric data from structural MRI was compared between groups. In addition, we used the same procedure to evaluate brain morphology of R6/2, zQ175, HdhQ250 HD mice models. RESULTS: Participants with JHD had substantially reduced intracranial volumes. After controlling for the small intracranial volume size, the volumes of subcortical regions (caudate, putamen, globus pallidus, and thalamus) and of cortical white matter were significantly decreased in patients with JHD. However, the cerebellum was proportionately enlarged in the JHD sample. The cerebral cortex was largely unaffected. Likewise, HD mice had a lower volume of striatum and a higher volume of cerebellum, mirroring the human MRI results. CONCLUSIONS: The primary pathology of JOHD extends beyond changes in the striatal volume. Brain morphology in both mice and human patients with JHD shows proportional cerebellar enlargement. This pattern of brain changes may explain the unique picture of hypokinetic motor symptoms in JHD, which is not seen in the hyperkinetic chorea-like phenotype of adult-onset HD.",Journal Article,,0.02

To address this, we investigate the degree to which ADHD symptomatology is associated with white matter microstructure and cerebral cortical thickness in a large population-based sample of adolescents. Critically, we then test the extent to which multimodal correlates of ADHD symptomatology are related to ADHD polygenic risk score (PRS). Neuroimaging, genetic, and behavioral data were obtained from the IMAGEN study. A dimensional ADHD composite score was derived from multi-informant ratings of ADHD symptomatology. Using tract-based spatial statistics, whole brain voxel-wise regressions between fractional anisotropy (FA) and ADHD composite score were calculated. Local cortical thickness was regressed on ADHD composite score. ADHD PRS was based on a very recent genome-wide association study, and calculated using PRSice. ADHD composite score was negatively associated with FA in several white matter pathways, including bilateral superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculi (p < 0.05, corrected). ADHD composite score was negatively associated with orbitofrontal cortical thickness (p < 0.05, corrected). The ADHD composite score was correlated with ADHD PRS (p < 0.001). FA correlates of ADHD symptomatology were significantly associated with ADHD PRS, whereas cortical thickness correlates of ADHD symptomatology were unrelated to ADHD PRS. Variation in hyperactive/inattentive symptomatology was associated with white matter microstructure, which, in turn, was related to ADHD PRS. Results suggest that genetic risk for ADHD symptomatology may be tied to biological processes affecting white matter microstructure.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.94

Exposure of infant macaques to ketamine impairs performance in selected domains of the Operant Test Battery (OTB), which can also be administered to children. This study determined whether a similar pattern of results on the OTB is found in children exposed to procedures requiring general anaesthesia before age 3 yr. METHODS: We analysed data from the Mayo Anesthesia Safety in Kids (MASK) study, in which unexposed, singly-exposed, and multiply-exposed children born in Olmsted County, MN, USA, from 1994 to 2007 were sampled using a propensity-guided approach and prospectively underwent OTB testing at ages 8-12 or 15-20 yr, using five tasks that generated 15 OTB test scores. RESULTS: In primary analysis, none of the OTB test scores depended upon anaesthesia exposure status when corrected for multiple comparisons. Cluster analysis identified four clusters of subjects, with cluster membership determined by relative performance on the OTB tasks. There was no evidence of association between exposure status and cluster membership. Exploratory factor analysis showed that the OTB scores loaded onto four factors. The score for one factor was significantly less in multiply-exposed children (mean standardised difference -0.28 [95% confidence interval, -0.55 to -0.01; P=0.04]), but significance did not survive a sensitivity analysis accounting for outlying values. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide little evidence to support the hypothesis that children exposed to procedures requiring anaesthesia show deficits on OTB tasks that are similar to those observed in non-human primates.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study",,0.02

In our unmatched case-control study, ERPA was recognized when there was an end QRS notch (J wave) or slur on the downslope of a prominent R wave with and without ST-segment elevation and the peak of the notch or J wave (Jp) >/=0.1 mV in >/=2 contiguous leads, excluding V1-V3 anterior lead, and QRS duration (measured in leads in which a notch or slur is absent) <120 ms or ST-segment elevation >0.1 mV in >/=2 contiguous leads, excluding V1-V3, and QRS duration <120 ms. The DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition) criteria were used to diagnose ADHD. Our data analysis suggested a significant association between ERPA presence and ADHD (n = 603, P = .020). Our logistic regression model suggests that patients with ERPA (n = 167) were 2.778 times more likely to have a diagnosis of ADHD after controlling for age, gender, and ethnicity (95% confidence interval for odds ratio 1.087-7.100, P = .033).

METHODS: A total of 377 children (aged 6-18 years) with CKD stages I-V (n = 199), on dialysis (n = 43), or with a kidney transplant (n = 135) were recruited from 2012 to 2016 in Australia and New Zealand. Associations of five socioeconomic status (SES) components and the global SES index with parent-rated health of the child were examined using adjusted logistic regression. RESULTS: The median age of participants was 12.6 years (interquartile range (IQR) 8.9-15.5). In the entire cohort, the adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for poor parent-rated health were 1.85 (1.13-3.03) for lower household income, 1.78 (1.08-2.96) for families that did not own their own home, 2.50 (1.50-4.16) for caregivers who rated their financial status as poor, 0.84 (0.51-1.38) for lower educational attainment, and 1.68 (1.04-2.72) for children whose primary caregivers were unemployed. With reference to the highest global SES index quartile, adjusted ORs for poor parent-rated health in descending order were 1.49 (0.69-3.21), 2.11 (1.06-4.20), and 2.20 (1.09-4.46), respectively. The association between low SES and poor parent-rated health was modified by CKD stage, where lower global SES index was independently associated with poor parent-rated health in children with CKD stages I-V, but not children on dialysis or with kidney transplants (p = 0.04).

Existing treatment options are often ineffective and associated with a host of adverse effects, causing those that are affected to seek alternative treatments. Cannabis based products have attracted significant attention over recent years, primarily driven by reports of miraculous cures and a renewed public preference for 'natural' therapies, thus placing intense pressure on health professionals and the government for regulatory change. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the potential role for cannabis in the treatment of CDD. Key areas discussed include the history, mechanism of action, efficacy and safety of cannabis based preparations as well as the burden related to CDD. The evidence supports the use of cannabinoids, especially cannabidiol, in similar forms of refractory epilepsy including Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes. Evidence for cannabinoids specifically in CDD is limited but growing, with multiple anecdotal reports and an open-label trial showing cannabidiol to be associated with a significant reduction in seizure activity.

Neuroimaging studies have begun to map the social brain; however, the specific neural substrates contributing to social deficits in neurodevelopmental disorders remain unclear. Three hundred and twelve children underwent structural magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (controls = 32, OCD = 44, ADHD = 77, ASD = 159; mean age = 11). Their social deficits were quantified on the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) and the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET). Multivariable regression models were used to examine the structural neuroimaging correlates of social deficits, with both a region of interest and a whole-brain vertex-wise approach. For the region of interest analysis, social brain regions were grouped into three networks: (1) lateral mentalization (e.g., temporal-parietal junction), (2) frontal cognitive (e.g., orbitofrontal cortex), and (3) subcortical affective (e.g., limbic system) regions. Overall, social communication deficits on the SCQ were associated with thinner cortices in the left lateral regions and the right insula, and decreased volume in the ventral striatum, across diagnostic groups (p = 0.006 to <0.0001). Smaller subcortical volumes were associated with more severe social deficits on the SCQ in ASD and ADHD, and less severe deficits in OCD. On the RMET, larger amygdala/hippocampal volumes were associated with fewer deficits across groups. Overall, patterns of associations were similar in ASD and ADHD, supporting a common underlying biology and the blurring of the diagnostic boundaries between these disorders.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.53

This difference represents a possible mechanism impacting upon the development of more complex social-communicative behaviors. The aim of this study was to develop and test the efficacy of a novel attention bias modification paradigm to alter social attention, specifically orienting to faces. Children with ASD (n = 66), aged between 5 and 12 years, were randomized to play either a social attention training or control game for 15 min. Children playing the training game were reinforced for attending to and engaging with social characters, whereas children in the control group were equally rewarded for attending to both social and non-social characters. Eye-tracking measures were obtained before and after gameplay. There was a significant increase in the percentage of first fixations to faces, relative to objects, after social attention training compared to a control group, associated with a medium effect size (partial eta = 0.15). The degree of social attention change in the training group was inversely associated with restricted and repetitive behaviors and moderated by comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnoses, suggestive of differential training effects based on individual symptom profiles. By using the principles of attention bias modification, we demonstrated that social attention can be acutely modified in children with ASD, with an increased tendency to orient attention toward faces after brief social attention training. Modifying attentional biases may therefore represent a potential novel mechanism to alter the development of social communication trajectories. Autism Res 2019, 12: 527-535 (c) 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Some children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) do not look at faces or eyes as much as their non-ASD peers do. Using a game where players have to pay attention to characters with faces to score points, we found that children playing the game began to look more at faces, even outside of the game. Looking at faces is an important prerequisite to many social interactions, telling us about others' emotions and states of attention-things that become harder to understand when they are not seen. If children with ASD could use games to help train looking at faces in real life, then they may be in a better position to understand and participate in social exchanges.","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.57

While structured diagnostic interviews have been developed to aide in the diagnosis of pediatric BP disorder, these tools are lengthy, costly, and not widely available. One possible diagnostic aid is the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL). OBJECTIVE: To assess the diagnostic utility of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)-Bipolar (BP) profile to identify children with a diagnosis of BP-I disorder. METHOD: Subjects were derived from four independent datasets of children and adolescents with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and BP-I. Subjects were recruited from pediatric and psychiatric clinics and the community. All subjects had structured clinical interviews with raters blinded to subject ascertainment status. We used an empirically-derived profile from the CBCL consisting of an aggregate t-score from the Attention, Anxiety/Depression, and Aggression subscales (CBCL-BP profile) to operationalize the presence or absence of bipolar symptoms. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to examine the ability of the CBCL-BP profile to identify children with and without a structured interview diagnosis of BP-I disorder. RESULTS: The sample consisted of 661 subjects (mean age: 11.7 +/- 3.3 years, 57% male, and 94% Caucasian). Twenty percent of participants (N=130) met structured interview criteria for a full diagnosis of BP-I disorder. The ROC analysis of the CBCL-BP profile yielded an area under the curve of 0.91. A t-score of >/=195 on the CBCL-BP profile correctly classified 86% of subjects with BP-I disorder with 80% sensitivity, 87% specificity, 61% positive predictive value, 95% negative predictive value. CONCLUSION: The CBCL-BP profile efficiently discriminated pediatric subjects with and without a structured interview diagnosis of BP-I disorder. Findings suggest that the CBCL-BP profile may be an efficient tool to help identify children who are very likely to suffer from BP-I disorder.",Journal Article,"Conflicts of Interest Dr. Amy Yule: Dr. Amy Yule received grant support from the Massachusetts General Hospital Louis V.

Over time, the progressive nature of the disease increases the risk of complications such as falls and loss of independence, having a profound impact on quality of life. The complexity and heterogeneity of symptoms therefore warrant a holistic, multidisciplinary approach. Specific healthcare professionals, e.g. the movement disorders neurologist and the PD nurse specialist, are considered essential members of this multidisciplinary team. However, with our increasing knowledge about different aspects of the disease, other disciplines are also being recognized as important contributors to the healthcare team. Areas covered: The authors describe a selection of these relatively newly-recognized disciplines, including the specialist in vascular medicine, gastroenterologist, pulmonologist, neuro-ophthalmologist, urologist, geriatrician/elderly care physician, palliative care specialist and the dentist. Furthermore, they share the view of a person with PD on how patients and caregivers should be involved in the multidisciplinary team. Finally, they have included a perspective on the new role of the movement disorder neurologist, with care delivery via 'tele-neurology'. Expert commentary: Increased awareness about the potential role of these 'new' professionals will further improve disease management and quality of life of PD patients.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.06

This study explores the course of (and relationships over time) between sleep problems and concurrent dimensional difficulties relating to anxiety/depression, attention deficiency, and aggressive behaviors in childhood and adolescence. The latter three may jointly form a broad syndrome, the dysregulation profile. METHODS: Young people from the Raine Study, a large community cohort sample (N = 1625) were followed from age 5 to 17 years. Developmental courses of sleep problems and its concurrent regulatory difficulties were estimated separately and jointly. RESULTS: The majority of adolescents reported low levels of problems and which appeared to be stable over time, while a small group (rates between 7.8% and 10.1%) reported enduring problematic developmental courses. Sleep problems and regulatory difficulties shared a strong association in their development over time (individual's probabilities of having the same courses, i.e. low-low and high-high, were between 89.8% and 92.3%). Furthermore, having persistent sleep problems over time was associated with an increased risk of having regulatory difficulties by approximately 10 times, and vice versa. CONCLUSION: Findings from this study provide empirical evidence for a strong mutual association in the development of sleep problems and difficulties of dysregulation with emotion, cognition, and aggression. It may be suggested that a positive screening of one such psychopathological dimension should lead to a careful assessment, not only to reduce the problem in question but also to prevent the youth from further problems.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.09

In summary, the onset of psychosis was not associated with deterioration in cognitive ability. However, specific findings suggest that immediate verbal learning and memory, and processing speed may be relevant domains for future risk models and early intervention research in UHR individuals.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

METHODS: A cohort of 209 community-dwelling individuals without dementia aged 47-90 years old was recruited for this 3-year study. Participants underwent neuropsychological and clinical assessments annually. Participants were divided into SMCs and non-memory complainers (NMCs) using a single question at baseline and a memory complaints questionnaire following baseline, to evaluate differential patterns of complaints. In addition, comprehensive assessment of memory complaints was undertaken to evaluate whether severity and consistency of complaints differentially predicted cognitive function. RESULTS: SMC and NMC individuals were significantly different on various features of SMCs. Greater overall severity (but not consistency) of complaints was significantly associated with current and future cognitive functioning. CONCLUSIONS: SMC individuals present distinctive features of memory complaints as compared to NMCs. Further, the severity of complaints was a significant predictor of future cognition. However, SMC did not significantly predict change over time in this sample. These findings warrant further research into the specific features of SMCs that may portend subsequent neuropathological and cognitive changes when screening individuals at increased future risk of dementia.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Because depression and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are frequently comorbid and share a complex relationship, we hypothesized that ADHD may be a predictive factor for the diagnosis of TRD. This exploratory study aimed to determine the percentage of undetected ADHD in those with TRD and evaluate factors associated with treatment resistance and undetected ADHD in depressed patients. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Adults referred (n=160) for psychiatric consultation completed a structured interview (MINI Plus, Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview Plus) to assess the presence of psychiatric disorders. RESULTS: TRD was significantly associated with the number of diagnoses (P<0.001), past (P<0.001) and present medications (P<0.001), chronic anhedonia (P=0.013), and suicide ideation (P=0.008). Undetected ADHD was present in 34% of TRD patients. The number of referral diagnoses (P<0.001), failed medications (P=0.002), and past selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor failures (P=0.035) were predictive of undetected ADHD in TRD. CONCLUSION: Undetected ADHD may be more prevalent among TRD patients than previously thought. In addition, TRD patients are more likely to present with psychiatric comorbidity than non-TRD patients. Screening patients with depression for the presence of ADHD and chronic anhedonia/low hedonic tone may help identify patients with TRD and undetected ADHD and improve treatment outcomes.",Journal Article,"Disclosure Irvin Epstein has been a consultant or speaker's bureau member of Janssen-Ortho Inc. and has participated in clinical trials for Bristol-Myers Squibb, Takeda, Shire, Pfizer, Roche, Purdue, Janssen Inc., and Forest.

Primary disabilities, such as impairment in memory, attention, cognition, language, executive function, and adaptive function, can lead to young people with FASD becoming engaged with the justice system. Little is known about the extent of FASD in youth detention in Australia, or of the capacity custodial staff have to manage and support young people with FASD. In tandem with a study assessing the prevalence of FASD among youth in detention in Western Australia (WA), this study aims to establish the current knowledge, attitudes, experiences and practices regarding FASD and other neurodevelopmental impairments among youth custodial officers in order to develop training resources for this workforce. METHODS: We invited youth custodial officers in the only youth detention centre in WA to participate in an online or hardcopy survey. The survey was developed following extensive consultation with the workforce and investigated their knowledge, attitudes, experiences and practices relating to FASD and other neurodevelopmental impairments. This included experience working with young people with FASD and other impairments, and attitudes towards relevant training. RESULTS: 112 youth custodial officers (51% of the youth custodial workforce) completed the survey. While many respondents had heard of FASD (77%) and understood it is relevant to the justice system (74%), limited in-depth FASD knowledge existed. Many respondents were unsure or unaware that FASD is permanent brain damage (53%) and cannot be outgrown (57%). Respondents were infrequently informed if a young person in detention had a diagnosis of FASD. Almost all custodial officers indicated motivation to complete training to further understand FASD (92%) and other neurodevelopmental impairments (94%), with particular interest in the application of management strategies appropriate for affected young people. CONCLUSIONS: A lack of specific knowledge, inadequate training to recognise and manage young people with neurodevelopmental impairments, and inconsistent information-sharing processes reduce the ability of the custodial workforce to care for young people with FASD and other neurodevelopmental impairments. These findings have supported the development and evaluation of training resources targeting the specific needs and requests of the WA youth custodial workforce, and this is now underway.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

However, the co-contributions of short sleep duration and SDB on neurodevelopment in pre-school children are relatively unknown. METHODS: We assessed both sleep duration and SDB by quarterly questionnaire from three months to two years of age among Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development (CHILD) birth cohort participants. Group-based modeling determined trajectories of total, daytime, and nighttime sleep duration and SDB. Linear regression was used to assess the impact of sleep duration and SDB trajectories on cognitive (primary outcome) and language (secondary) development at two years of age as assessed by the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III) (mean 100; standard deviation of 15). RESULTS: Of the 822 CHILD Edmonton participants, 703 (86%) were still enrolled at two years of age with 593 having BSID-III data at twoyears of age. Trajectory analysis identified four total sleep durations phenotypes [short sleepers (17.9%), decline to short sleepers (21.1%), intermediate sleepers (36.9%) and long sleepers (24.1%)]. Compared to children with intermediate sleep durations, short sleepers had a 5.2-point lower cognitive development score at twoyears of age [standard error (SE) 1.7; p = 0.002]. Nocturnal sleep duration, compared to daytime sleep duration had the greatest effect on cognitive development. We also identified three SDB symptom trajectories [early-onset SDB (15.7%), late-onset SDB (14.2%), and persistent SDB (5.3%)] and 79.5% of children had no SDB symptoms. Children with persistent SDB also had a 5.3-point lower language score (SE 2.7; p = 0.05) compared to children with no SDB. SDB trajectories were not associated with cognitive development. CONCLUSION: In a population-representative birth cohort study, both short sleep duration and SDB were associated with adverse neurodevelopment at two years of age. Children with short nighttime sleep duration had lowered cognitive and language scores and children with persistent SDB also had lower language scores.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

This is not just a coincidence, occurring about 250 years after the first description of the human cerebellum. The cerebellum contains the majority of neurons in the central nervous system and it is heavily connected with almost all cortical and subcortical areas of the supratentorial region as well as with the brainstem and the spinal cord. Cerebellar circuits are embedded in large-scale networks contributing to motor control and neurocognition. From a phenotypic standpoint, damage to cerebellar lobules interconnected with the sensorimotor cortices leads to a cerebellar motor syndrome, whereas lesions of the posterolateral cerebellum cause cognitive and neuropsychiatric impairments which may or may not be subtle. This topographic rule is valid in children and adults. Midline posterior vermal lesions cause behavioral/affective dysregulation, especially in kids. The extent of the spectrum of human cerebellar disorders is increasingly recognized from the fetus to the elderly, with recognition of consequences for the quality of life and socioeconomic costs due to lifelong morbidity of many cerebellar ataxias/pathologies. The prolonged duration of human cerebellar development makes the cerebellum especially susceptible to developmental disruption, both genetic and nongenetic. This explains the current emphasis on the clarification of the developmental course and impact of the cerebellum. The understanding of how germinal matrix zones and migration of neurons and glial cells end in a highly organized and foliated human cerebellum is essential. This is greatly accelerated by inputs from rodent developmental studies, in particular because cerebellar anatomy is conserved across species. Still, numerous questions on human fetal development remain unanswered. Although both advanced neuroimaging and genetic studies are currently leading to a better definition and understanding of the multitude of cerebellar symptoms, there is a gap, with a great need to develop therapies aiming at first, protection of the cerebellum during development, and second, restoration of cerebellar function in children and in adults. Dynamic profiles of the compensatory processes from newborns to elderly require specific studies.","Journal Article, Review",,0.02

This study examined factors associated with greater FCR morbidity, according to a cognitive processing model, in cancer survivors who screened positively for clinically significant FCR seeking psychological treatment through the ConquerFear trial. METHODS: Participants had completed treatment for breast, colorectal or melanoma cancer 2 months to 5 years previously and scored >/= 13/36 on the Fear of Cancer Recurrence Inventory-Short Form (FCRI-SF). Hierarchical regression analyses examined associations between demographic, medical and psychological variables, namely metacognitions (MCQ-30), post-traumatic stress symptoms (IES-R) and FCR (FCRI total score). RESULTS: Two hundred and ten (95%) of the 222 cancer survivors who consented to the ConquerFear trial completed the baseline questionnaire. Participants were predominantly (89%) breast cancer survivors. The final regression model accounted for 68% of the variance in FCR (demographic and medical variables 13%, metacognitions 26%, post-traumatic stress symptoms 28%). Negative metacognitive beliefs about worry and intrusive post-traumatic stress symptoms were significant individual correlates of FCR, but negative beliefs about worry did not significantly moderate the impact of intrusions on FCR morbidity. CONCLUSIONS: Results provide partial support for the cognitive processing model of FCR. Psychological factors were found to play an important role in FCR morbidity after controlling for demographic/medical factors. More intrusive thoughts and negative beliefs about worry were strong independent predictors of FCR morbidity. Cancer survivors with clinically significant FCR may benefit from assessment for intrusive thoughts and metacognitions and delivery of trauma- and/or metacognitive-based interventions accordingly.",Journal Article,,0.0

METHOD: Using eye-tracking technology we investigated the time taken to fixate on a face and the percentage of time spent attending to faces relative to the rest of the screen within social scenes in 24 children with NF1 (17 females, seven males; mean age 10y 4mo [SD 1y 9mo]). Results were compared with those of 24 age-matched typically developing controls (11 females, 13 males; mean age 10y 3mo [SD 2y]). RESULTS: There was no significant between-group differences in time taken to initially fixate on a face (p=0.617); however, children with NF1 spent less time attending to faces within scenes than controls (p=0.048). Decreased attention to faces was associated with elevated autism traits in children with NF1. INTERPRETATION: Children with NF1 spend less time attending to faces than typically developing children when presented in social scenes. Our findings contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that abnormal face processing is a key aspect of the social-cognitive phenotype of NF1 and appears to be related to autism spectrum disorder traits. Clinicians should consider the impact of reduced attention to faces when designing and implementing treatment programmes for social dysfunction in this population. WHAT THIS PAPER ADDS: Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) demonstrated atypical gaze behaviour when attending to faces. NF1 gaze behaviour was characterized by normal initial fixation on faces but shorter face dwell time.

METHODS: This cross-sectional analysis of data from the 2012 Kids' Inpatient Database included 483,281 hospitalizations in general and children's hospitals of persons under age 21 with a primary or secondary behavioral diagnosis. RESULTS: The admission rate with any behavioral diagnosis was 5.5 per 1,000 children in the U.S. population, with 2.9 having a primary behavioral diagnosis. Common primary diagnoses included depression (34%), other mood (31%), psychotic (9%), and substance use (7%) disorders. The most common behavioral diagnoses secondary to a primary diagnosis that is not behavioral were depression (26%), attention-deficit disorder (26%), and substance use disorders (22%). Suicide or self-harm was rarely the primary diagnosis (.1%) but complicated 12% of admissions with a primary behavioral diagnosis. Variations in admissions (per 1,000 children in the U.S. population) with a primary behavioral diagnosis were noted by race-ethnicity (blacks, 3.2; whites, 2.9; and Hispanics, 1.4), insurance (public, 2.9; private, 2.0), and geographic region. Fifty-nine of every 1,000 peripartum admissions in the 12-20 age group had a secondary behavioral diagnosis. Patients with behavioral comorbidities were more likely to be transferred to another facility (8.0% versus 2.2%, p<.001).

This study aimed to predict neuropsychological outcome after pediatric concussion by using a sufficiently large sample to explore a vast array of predictors. METHOD: A total of 311 children and adolescents (6-18 years old) with concussion were assessed in the emergency department to document acute symptomatology and to screen for cognitive functioning. At 4 and 12 weeks postinjury, they completed tests of intellectual functioning, attention/working memory, executive functions, verbal memory, processing speed, and fine motor abilities. Multiple hierarchical logistic and linear regressions were performed to assess the contribution of premorbid factors, acute symptoms, and acute cognitive screening (Standardized Assessment of Concussion-Child) to aspects of neuropsychological outcome: (a) cognitive inefficiency (defined using a modified Neuropsychological Impairment Rule; Beauchamp et al., 2015) and (b) neuropsychological performance (defined using principal component analysis). RESULTS: Neuropsychological impairment was present in 10.3% and 4.5% of participants at 4 and 12 weeks postinjury, respectively. At 4 weeks postinjury, cognitive inefficiency was predicted by premorbid factors and acute cognitive screening, whereas at 12 weeks it was predicted by acute symptoms. Neuropsychological performance at 4 weeks was predicted by a combination of premorbid factors, acute symptoms, and acute cognitive screening, whereas as at 12 weeks, only acute cognitive screening predicted performance. CONCLUSIONS: Neuropsychological outcome after pediatric concussion is not attributable solely to preexisting problems but is instead associated with a combination of preexisting and injury-related variables. Acute cognitive screening appears to be particularly useful in predicting neuropsychological status after concussion.

It also investigated whether changes in the prevalence of disorders over this time varied for children living in families containing 2 parents versus single parents, and families with high versus low income. METHOD: The study used data from national surveys conducted in Australia in 1998 (N = 3,597) and 2013 to 2014 (N = 5,359). In both surveys, the participating individuals were randomly selected from all 6- to 17-year-olds in Australia, and mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV (DISC-IV), completed by parents. RESULTS: There was little change in the overall prevalence of mental disorders between 1998 (12.5%, 95% CI = 11.4-13.7) and 2013 to 2014 (11.1%, 95% CI = 10.1-12.2). Although there were some differences in the changes for children with different disorders, most were small in magnitude. Specifically, MDD prevalence increased from 2.1% (95% CI = 1.7-2.7) to 3.2% (95% CI = 2.7-3.8), ADHD prevalence declined from 9.9% (95% CI = 8.9-10.9) to 7.8% (95% CI = 6.9-8.7), and CD prevalence declined from 2.7% (95% CI = 2.2-3.3) to 2.1% (95% CI = 1.7-2.7). There was a persisting pattern of higher prevalence among children living in single-parent and low-income households.

There is growing concern regarding the influence of exogenous oxytocin (OT) administration in early life on later social and emotional development, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD). No study has examined offspring development in relation to the dose of exogenous oxytocin administered during labour. METHODS: Between 1989 and 1992, 2,900 mothers were recruited prior to the 18th week of pregnancy, delivering 2,868 live offspring. The Child Behaviour Checklist was used to measure offspring behavioural difficulties at ages 5, 8, 10, 14 and 17 years. Autism spectrum disorder was formally diagnosed by consensus of a team of specialists. At 20 years, offspring completed a measure of autistic-like traits, the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). Oxytocin exposure prior to birth was analysed using categorical and continuous approaches (maternal oxytocin dose) with univariate and multivariate statistical techniques. RESULTS: Categorical analyses of oxytocin exposure prior to birth demonstrated no group differences in any measures of child behaviour. A small in magnitude dose-response association was observed for clinically significant total behaviour symptoms (adjusted odds ratio 1.03; 95% CI: 1.01-1.06, p < .01). Exogenous oxytocin administration prior to birth was not associated with ASD (OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.15-2.12, p = .46) or high levels of autistic-like traits (p = .93), as assessed by the AQ. CONCLUSIONS: This study is the first to investigate longitudinal mental health outcomes associated with the use of oxytocin-based medications during labour. The results do not provide evidence to support the theory that exogenous OT has a clinically significant negative impact on the long-term mental health of children.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

SUMMARY ANSWER: Offspring of mothers with PCOS were at higher risk of failure on the Ages and Stages Questionnaire (ASQ). WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: There is growing evidence that offspring of mothers with PCOS may be at higher risk for developmental disorders due to potential exposure to hyperandrogenism and insulin resistance. Few studies exist regarding maternal PCOS and early childhood development in the USA. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: The Upstate KIDS Study is a population-based prospective cohort study of infants born between 2008 and 2010 in New York State (excluding New York City), originally designed to study-and finding no impact of-infertility treatment exposure on child development. Children were followed up to 36 months of age. In all, 4453 mothers completed one or more developmental screening instruments for 5388 children (35.5% twins) up to 36 months of age. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: In our study, 458 mothers (10.3%) reported a healthcare provider's diagnosis of PCOS, as well as the related treatment received, on the baseline study questionnaire. Parents completed the ASQ on their child's development at 4, 8, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months of age to assess fine motor, gross motor, communication, personal-social functioning and problem-solving cognitive domains. We used generalized linear mixed models to estimate odds ratios (OR) between PCOS diagnosis and failures in the ASQ adjusted for maternal age, race, BMI, education, marital status, smoking, alcohol consumption, diabetes, insurance and plurality. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE: Diagnosis of PCOS was associated with increased risk of the offspring failing the fine motor domain (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.77; 95% CI: 1.09, 2.89), largely driven by higher risk in female singletons (aOR = 2.23; 1.16, 4.29). Twins of mothers with PCOS had higher risk of failing the communication (aOR = 1.94; 1.19, 3.18) and personal-social functioning (aOR = 1.76; 1.12, 2.77) domains compared to twins born to mothers without PCOS. Compared to offspring of women without PCOS, offspring of women who reported receiving no treatment for their PCOS had a stronger association with failing the ASQ (aOR = 1.68; 0.95, 2.75) than the association among offspring of women who reported PCOS treatment (aOR = 1.16; 0.79, 1.73). LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Further study is needed to confirm the role of maternal PCOS in early offspring development with provider-validated diagnosis of PCOS. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: If confirmed, these findings suggest that offspring of women with PCOS may be at increased risk for developmental delay.

DESIGN: A prospective cohort study of near-drowning children. SETTING: 95 drowning and near-drowning admissions, 0-16 years of age, from January 2009 to December 2013, to The Children's Hospital at Westmead, Sydney, NSW, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 23 children both met the criteria and had parental consent for the study. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Identification of the long-term deficits in behaviour, executive function, motor skills, communicative skills and well-being over a 5-year period. Assessment was undertaken at 3-6 months, 1 year, 3 years and 5 years after near-drowning at clinic visits. Physical developmental screening and executive function screening were done using Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Preschool version (BRIEF-P) and BRIEF. RESULT: 95 drowning and near-drowning episodes occurred during the study period. 10 (11%) children died, 28 were admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit and 64 directly to a ward. 3 children died in emergency department, 7 children had severe neurological deficit on discharge from the hospital. 23 were subsequently recruited into the study; 5 (22%) of these children had abnormalities in behaviour and/or executive function at some during their follow-up. CONCLUSION: Children admitted to hospital following a near-drowning event warrant long-term follow-up to identify any subtle sequelae which might be amenable to intervention to ensure optimal patient outcome.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Competing interests: None declared.,0.02

Objective: To estimate the quality of health care for children in Australia in inpatient and ambulatory health care settings. Design, Setting, and Participants: Multistage stratified sample with medical record review to assess adherence with quality indicators extracted from clinical practice guidelines for 17 common, high-burden clinical conditions (noncommunicable [n = 5], mental health [n = 4], acute infection [n = 7], and injury [n = 1]), such as asthma, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, tonsillitis, and head injury. For these 17 conditions, 479 quality indicators were identified, with the number varying by condition, ranging from 9 for eczema to 54 for head injury. Four hundred medical records were targeted for sampling for each of 15 conditions while 267 records were targeted for anxiety and 133 for depression. Within each selected medical record, all visits for the 17 targeted conditions were identified, and separate quality assessments made for each. Care was evaluated for 6689 children 15 years of age and younger who had 15240 visits to emergency departments, for inpatient admissions, or to pediatricians and general practitioners in selected urban and rural locations in 3 Australian states. These visits generated 160202 quality indicator assessments. Exposures: Quality indicators were identified through a systematic search of local and international guidelines. Individual indicators were extracted from guidelines and assessed using a 2-stage Delphi process. Main Outcomes and Measures: Quality of care for each clinical condition and overall. Results: Of 6689 children with surveyed medical records, 53.6% were aged 0 to 4 years and 55.5% were male. Adherence to quality of care indicators was estimated at 59.8% (95% CI, 57.5%-62.0%; n = 160202) across the 17 conditions, ranging from a high of 88.8% (95% CI, 83.0%-93.1%; n = 2638) for autism to a low of 43.5% (95% CI, 36.8%-50.4%; n = 2354) for tonsillitis. The mean adherence by condition category was estimated as 60.5% (95% CI, 57.2%-63.8%; n = 41265) for noncommunicable conditions (range, 52.8%-75.8%); 82.4% (95% CI, 79.0%-85.5%; n = 14622) for mental health conditions (range, 71.5%-88.8%); 56.3% (95% CI, 53.2%-59.4%; n = 94037) for acute infections (range, 43.5%-69.8%); and 78.3% (95% CI, 75.1%-81.2%; n = 10278) for injury. Conclusions and Relevance: Among a sample of children receiving care in Australia in 2012-2013, the overall prevalence of adherence to quality of care indicators for important conditions was not high. For many of these conditions, the quality of care may be inadequate.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.06

However, there is no evidence yet to support the routine use of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of core symptom domains. Challenges in the field include biological heterogeneity within ASD, lack of biomarkers that clarify biological heterogeneity or predict response to treatment, lack of data across the lifespan, and suboptimal outcome measures. SUMMARY: Several compounds have evidence for the treatment of co-occurring symptoms in children and youth with ASD, although pharmacological interventions for core symptoms are still lacking. Identifying the various biologies underling ASD and developing biomarkers that stratify biologically homogeneous populations are both necessary to realize the promise of precision medicine in ASD.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.26

OBJECTIVES: We examined the factor structure of the FACT-Cog version 3 in samples of cancer patients, older adults, and students. METHODS: Data from three populations were sourced. Cancer patient data (N = 158) came from two studies, one evaluating a web-based cognitive training program, and the other evaluating symptoms in patients receiving chemotherapy. The older adult sample (N = 477) was commercial brain training users in the general population. The student sample (N = 154) came from a study examining the relation between cognitive test performance and perceived cognitive function. RESULTS: The patient sample conformed to the traditional four-factor structure (impairments, abilities, noticeability, and quality of life), with some support for separating the broad impairment/ability factors into specific cognitive domains. The older adult sample was best described using both impairments/abilities and specific cognitive domains. The student sample suggested two impairment/ability factors but separation of concentration/acuity and memory/verbal impairment items. CONCLUSION: The FACT-Cog can be used in populations other than cancer patients, with modifications to the scoring system. Even when used with cancer patients, it is worth considering scoring specific cognitive domains separately.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

METHODS: Twenty-one youth (17 males) aged 10-14 years recruited from the community completed verbal and non-verbal WM tasks pre- and post-concussion. Performance was measured using accuracy and performance errors (false alarms and misses). Pre- and post-tests were compared using a Wilcoxon signed rank test, and effect size was determined using matched-pairs rank biserial correlation. RESULTS: Comparisons showed lower verbal WM accuracy at post-test, greater verbal and non-verbal WM false alarm errors at post-test, and greater verbal WM miss errors at post-test (all r >/= 0.30). Correlations between performance and characteristics revealed associations between younger youth and lower non-verbal WM accuracy and more false alarms at post-test, as well as an association among non-verbal WM miss errors, higher PCS scores and fewer days since injury at post-test.

In particular, ADHD patients showed substantially diminished intrinsic coupling for 7 connections and increased coupling for 4 connections, with many differences involving connectivity with the anterior insula. Moreover, connectivity strength of several aberrant connections was found to be associated with core aspects of ADHD symptomatology, such as poor attention, difficulties with social functioning, and impaired cognitive control, attesting to the behavioural relevance of specific connectivity differences observed in the resting state.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.89

An investigation in secondary schools.,2017 Sep,Psychiatria Danubina,Juli MR,"Adolescent, Adult, *Body Image, Child, *Feeding and Eating Disorders, Female, Humans, Male, Schools, *Self Concept, Sex Factors, Surveys and Questionnaires, Thinness","INTRODUCTION: The clinical evidence shows that the onset of eating disorders is increasing in the prepubescent phase or even in childhood. Already starting from the prepubescence the certainties related to the body start to unwind and the individual is encouraged to build new ones, based both on the anatomic transformation of his/her own body and on the social expectation according to the identity. The onset of a Eating Disorders is normally between 13 and 25 years, but in the last years we recorded a lowering in the onset threshold to an age between 11 and 13 years, with some earlier cases at 7 years (Franzoni et al. 2012). Many theories consider body dissatisfaction as the immediate antecedent to the development of this eating disorder. Different studies have confirmed that a strong concern for physical appearance could sometimes precede an eating disorder (Cuzzolaro 2004). The alteration of the body image is the major predictive factor for the relapse, the patients themselves refer that it is one of the major obstacles for the realization of a lasting recovering. In the following study one hundred kids between 10 and 15 years old, without any Eating Disorders diagnosis, have been tested to evaluate whether if already from this age there is a concern about body image starting at this age, the fear of gaining weight and the desire to be slimmer. It is known, indeed, that these factors, if significantly present in a subject, can turn into predictive factors of a psychopathology. We need to build our body image over time; changing our percertion of reality can change also what we see, in particular the body image we strive for changes (Bianchini 2008). METHOD: 100 teenagers split in 53 females and 47 males aged between 10 and 14 years, randomly picked in the secondary school. RESULTS: The results of the study show that in the age between 10 and 15 years the concern for the body shape is already present, without difference between the genders. Although 45% of the sample is underweight, the Figure Raiting Scale test both males and females want to be of lesser weight. 91 subjects reached a BSQ test score of over 34, so most of the sample has a strong concern for their physical appearance. The results obtained by administering the BUT test also highlighted concern about the body with moderate gravity. DISCUSSION: Body dissatisfaction, as so many studies have confirmed, can be considered a precursor of psychopathology. Concerns concern both female gender and male gender. It is also necessary to pay close attention to the pressure exerted by family members, friends and the media towards a difficult to reach thinness ideal. That is why we need to focus on strengthening protective factors in adolescents with prevention and awareness campaigns which are properly targeted. CONCLUSION: The work resulted a useful reflection on the building of the body image as an early risk factor for the onset of pathologies linked to this concept. We need to commit to an educative practice of support for adolescent, recognition and sharing, which does not avoid the presence of the adults, but in fact it is enriched. It would be appreciated if we could introduce in the school, in the program of different subjects, the discussion regarding different aspects of a healthy nutrition and the formation of a solid self-esteem in order, for the students, to have a critical interpretation of the media message on food, body and beauty. It is desirable to promote the emancipation of the adolescents from a condition of dependence to discover their own place in the world. The educative action can help developing the research of the meaning of the own personality.",Journal Article,,0.04

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the oxytocin receptor gene (OXTR) have been shown to explain some variability in social abilities in control populations. Whether these variants similarly contribute to the severity of social deficits experienced by children with neurodevelopmental disorders is unclear. Social abilities were assessed in a group of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD, n = 341) or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD, n = 276) using two established social measures. Scores were compared by OXTR genotype (rs53576, rs237887, rs13316193, rs2254298). Unexpectedly, the two most frequently studied OXTR SNPs in the general population (rs53576 and rs2254298) were associated with an increased severity of social deficits in ASD (p < 0.0001 and p = 0.0005), yet fewer social deficits in ADHD (p = 0.007 and p < 0.0001).

However, we lack understanding of the neurobiological mechanisms underlying mindfulness in youth that should allow for more judicious application of these interventions in clinical and educational settings. METHODS: Using multi-echo multi-band fMRI, we examined dynamic (i.e., time-varying) and conventional static resting-state connectivity between core neurocognitive networks (i.e., salience/emotion, default mode, central executive) in 42 children and adolescents (ages 6-17). RESULTS: We found that trait mindfulness in youth relates to dynamic but not static resting-state connectivity. Specifically, more mindful youth transitioned more between brain states over the course of the scan, spent overall less time in a certain connectivity state, and showed a state-specific reduction in connectivity between salience/emotion and central executive networks.

The relationship between low or sporadic binge PAE and adverse child outcomes is not clear. This study examines the association between PAE in the general antenatal population and child neurodevelopment at 2 years, accounting for relevant contributing factors. METHODS: This prospective population-based cohort recruited 1570 pregnant women, providing sociodemographic, psychological and lifestyle information and alcohol use for five time periods. PAE categories were 'low', 'moderate/high', 'binge', in trimester 1 or throughout pregnancy. Measures of cognitive, language and motor development (Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development) were available for 554 children, while measures of sensory processing (Infant/Toddler Sensory Profile) and social-emotional development (Brief Infant Toddler Social Emotional Assessment) were available for 948. RESULTS: A positive association in univariate analysis with low-level PAE throughout pregnancy and cognition (beta=4.1, 95% CI -0.02 to 8.22, p=0.05) was attenuated by adjusting for environmental/social deprivation risk factors (beta=3.06 (-1.19 to 7.30), p=0.16). Early binge drinking, plus continued PAE at lower levels, was associated with the child being more likely to score low in sensation avoidance (adjusted OR 1.88 (1.03 to 3.41), p=0.04). CONCLUSION: Early binge exposure, followed by lower-level PAE, demonstrated an increase in sensation-avoiding behaviour. There were, however, no significant associations between PAE and neurodevelopment following adjustment for important confounders and modifiers. Follow-up is paramount to investigate subtle or later onset problems.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Competing interests: None declared.,0.0

PARTICIPANTS: School Principals provided written consent for teachers to administer the MCS in class to year 6 students at 829 NSW schools (35.0% of eligible schools). Parent or child opt-outs from participation were received for 4.3% of children, and MCS data obtained from 27 808 children (mean age 11.5 years, SD 0.5; 49.5% female), representing 85.9% of students at participating schools. FINDINGS TO DATE: Demographic characteristics of participating schools and children are representative of the NSW population. Children completed items measuring Social Integration, Prosocial Behaviour, Peer Relationship Problems, Supportive Relationships (at Home, School and in the Community), Empathy, Emotional Symptoms, Conduct Problems, Aggression, Attention, Inhibitory Control, Hyperactivity-Inattention, Total Difficulties (internalising and externalising psychopathology), Perceptual Sensitivity, Psychotic-Like Experiences, Personality, Self-esteem, Daytime Sleepiness and Connection to Nature. Distributions of responses on each item and construct demarcate competencies and vulnerabilities within the population: most children report mental health and well-being, but the population distribution spanned the full range of possible scores on every construct. FUTURE PLANS: Multiagency, intergenerational linkage of the MCS data with health, education, child protection, justice and early childhood development records took place late in 2016. Linked data were used to elucidate patterns of risk and protection across early and middle child development, and these data will provide a foundation for future record linkages in the cohort that will track mental and physical health, social and educational/occupational outcomes into adolescence and early adulthood.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",Competing interests: None declared.,0.23

Their concurrent impact on outcomes and phenotypes has not been investigated. We investigated the impact of comorbid autism and schizotypal disorders in children on executive functioning and socio-pragmatic skills - core features of both disorders. METHOD: Executive functioning (assessed with the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery) and socio-pragmatic skills (assessed using the Melbourne Assessment of Schizotypy in Kids) were investigated in a total of 67 (6-12 year old) children with autism ( n = 15; M/F = 10/5), schizotypal disorder ( n = 8; M/F = 5/3) and comorbid autism and schizotypal disorder ( n = 12; M/F = 5/7) and typically developing children ( n = 32; M/F = 17/15). RESULTS: Both the autism and schizotypal disorder groups performed more poorly than the typically developing group on socio-pragmatic skills and overall performance (i.e. number of stages completed) of the intra-/extra-dimensional set-shifting task (all ps < 0.001). Clear distinctions between the autism and schizotypal groups were present in the intra-/extra-dimensional task relative to the typically developing group - the autism group had difficulties with extra-dimensional shifts ( p < 0.001), and the schizotypal disorder group with intra-dimensional shifts ( p = 0.08). Interestingly, the overall performance of the comorbid group on the intra-/extra-dimensional task was not significantly different from the typically developing group, and they were superior to both the autism ( p = 0.019) and schizotypal disorder ( p = 0.042) groups on socio-pragmatic skills. CONCLUSION: The phenotypical overlap between autism and schizotypal disorders may be precipitated by different cognitive styles and/or mechanisms associated with attention and information processing. We propose that sustaining and switching attention represent two poles of irregularities across the autism and schizotypal spectra, which appear to converge in a compensatory manner in the comorbid group. Our findings highlight the importance of investigating children with a dual diagnosis of autism and schizotypal disorders, and raise intriguing questions about possible mechanisms to explain the attenuated impairment observed in the group of children with comorbid autism and schizotpyal disorders.",Journal Article,,0.13

A comprehensive systematic literature search was performed, followed by disorder-specific random-effects meta-analyses. Of the disorders investigated, ADHD was found to be the most common co-morbid disorder among children with FASD (52.9%), followed by ODD (12.9%), CD (7.0%), and ASD (2.6%). When compared with the general population of the USA, these rates are notably higher: 15 times higher for ADHD, 2 times higher for ASD, 3 times higher for CD, and 5 times higher for ODD.

This study estimated the national prevalence of bullying victimisation, perpetration and combined victim-perpetration experiences in a representative population-based sample of Australian youth. The relationships between the three types of bullying involvement with a range of mental health symptoms and diagnoses were also examined. METHODS: A randomly selected nationally representative sample aged 11-17 years ( N = 2967, Mage = 14.6 years; 51.6% male) completed the youth component of the Second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Wellbeing (Young Minds Matter). Parents or carers also completed a structured face-to-face interview that asked questions about a single randomly selected child in the household. The youth survey comprised self-reported bullying victimisation and perpetration (Olweus Bully-Victim Questionnaire-adapted), psychological distress (K10), emotional and behavioural problems (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), as well as self-harm, suicide attempts and substance use. Modules from the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV were administered to all youth and parents to assess for mental disorder diagnoses (major depressive disorder, any anxiety disorder and any externalising disorder [attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder and conduct disorder]). RESULTS: The 12-month prevalence of bullying victimisation was 13.3%, perpetration 1.6% and victim-perpetration 1.9%. Logistic regression models showed all forms of involvement in bullying were associated with increased risk of psychological distress, emotional and behavioural problems, substance use, self-harm and attempted suicide. Victimisation and victim-perpetration were associated with youth-reported major depressive disorder. There were also significant associations between bullying involvement and parent-reported diagnoses of major depressive disorder, any anxiety disorder and any externalising disorder. CONCLUSION: Bullying continues to be frequently experienced by Australian adolescents. The current findings showed that involvement in any bullying behaviour was associated with increased risk of concurrent mental health problems. This evidence can be used to inform decisions concerning the allocation of resources to address this important health issue.",Journal Article,,0.06

This review and quantitative synthesis of the available literature examined whether there are long-term impacts of childhood ADEM on neurocognitive functioning. A search of online databases (MEDLINE, EMBASE, EBSCO CINAHL, PsycINFO and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews) from their inception to October 2015 and reference lists identified 13 papers eligible for inclusion in the systematic review; seven of these were eligible for inclusion in meta-analyses. The systematic review indicated that, at a group level there is a positive long-term neuropsychological outcome from childhood onset ADEM. However, despite the apparent absence of long-term negative impacts of ADEM at a group level, at an individual level impairments in the areas of IQ, attention, executive functioning, processing speed, learning and memory, visuospatial skills and internalising symptoms were found in up to 43% of patients when aggregated across the studies. No significant negative effect of ADEM for any of the neuropsychological domains examined was found in meta-analyses. However, the effects for Processing Speed (r mean = -0.296 (CI 95% = -0.605-0.013)) and Internalising symptoms (r mean = 0.242 (CI 95% = -0.014-0.564)) approached significance (p = 0.06), suggesting a trend towards ADEM leading to long-term reduced processing speed and elevated internalising symptoms. Together, our findings suggest that despite a generally positive neurocognitive outcome post childhood ADEM there are a subset of individuals who can suffer from ongoing specific cognitive impairments. Clinical implications and research priorities are discussed.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",,0.02

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 24 young patients with ADHD participated in the 20-session training program. During phase I of training (2 weeks, 10 sessions), participants were trained on weekdays. During phase II, neurofeedback training occurred twice per week (5 weeks). The patients' inattention problems were measured at three assessment time points before (pre, T0) and after (post, T1) the training and at a 6-month follow-up (T2); the assessments included neuropsychological tests (Alertness and Divided Attention subtests of the Test for Attentional Performance; Sustained Attention Dots and Shifting Attentional Set subtests of the Amsterdam Neuropsychological Test) and questionnaire data (inattention subscales of the so-called Fremdbeurteilungsbogen fur Hyperkinetische Storungen and Child Behavior Checklist/4-18 [CBCL/4-18]). All data were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: The mean auditive reaction time in a Divided Attention task decreased significantly from T0 to T1 (medium effect), which was persistent over time and also found for a T0-T2 comparison (larger effects). In the Sustained Attention Dots task, the mean reaction time was reduced from T0-T1 and T1-T2 (small effects), whereas in the Shifting Attentional Set task, patients were able to increase the number of trials from T1-T2 and significantly diminished the number of errors (T1-T2 & T0-T2, large effects). CONCLUSION: First positive but very small effects and preliminary results regarding different parameters of attentional performance were detected in young individuals with ADHD. The limitations of the obtained preliminary data are the rather small sample size, the lack of a control group/a placebo condition and the open-label approach because of the clinical setting and retrospective analysis.

While a substantial body of international evidence indicates that these children display poorer cognitive and socio-emotional outcomes than children living in traditional families, research on childhood mental disorders is scarce. This report provides new evidence of the relationships between family structure and childhood mental disorders in an under-researched context, Australia. METHODS: We use recent, nationally representative data on children aged 4-17 from Young Minds Matter, the second Australian Child and Adolescent Survey of Mental Health and Well-being (N = 6310). Mental disorders were assessed using the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV and included social phobia, separation anxiety disorder, generalised anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, major depressive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and conduct disorder. RESULTS: Compared to children living in original families, children in one-parent, blended, and step families experienced a higher prevalence of mental disorders. Amongst children whose parents separated, the time since separation was not statistically significantly related to the prevalence of mental disorders.

However, because the current literature is based on inferences at group level, the translational value of the findings for everyday clinical practice is unclear. Here we examined whether psychopathological information could be used to make individualized predictions about clinical and functional outcomes in people at UHR. Participants included 416 people at UHR followed prospectively at the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation (PACE) Clinic in Melbourne, Australia. The data were analysed using Support Vector Machine (SVM), a supervised machine learning technique that allows inferences at the individual level. SVM predicted transition to psychosis with a specificity of 60.6%, a sensitivity of 68.6% and an accuracy of 64.6% (p<0.001). In addition, SVM predicted functioning with a specificity of 62.5%, a sensitivity of 62.5% and an accuracy of 62.5% (p=0.008). Prediction of transition was driven by disorder of thought content, attenuated positive symptoms and functioning, whereas functioning was best predicted by attention disturbances, anhedonia-asociality and disorder of thought content. These results indicate that psychopathological information allows individualized prognostic predictions with statistically significant accuracy. However, this level of accuracy may not be sufficient for clinical translation in real-world clinical practice.

It is important to identify predictors of QoL to support recovery. We examined long-term QoL after arterial ischaemic stroke concerning different variables. METHOD: Children registered in the Swiss Neuropediatric Stroke Registry and suffering from arterial ischaemic stroke between 2000 and 2008 were included. Two years post-stroke, assessments included intelligence quotient tests for cognitive impairment and modified Rankin Scale (mRS) for neurological impairment; 5 years post-stroke, the Kidscreen-27 was used for QoL, DSM-IV criteria screening was used for attention deficits, and the ABILHAND-Kids was used for manual motor skills. Age at stroke, sex, socioeconomic status, lesion characteristics, neuropsychological and motor outcome, and mRS were correlated with QoL measures. RESULTS: Seventy children were examined (49 males, 21 females; mean age 7y 2wks). Age at stroke, sex, socioeconomic status, and lesion characteristics did not influence QoL; IQ below average and attention deficits partially influenced QoL. The highest predictive value for QoL was found for manual motor impairment (p=0.002) and mRS scores (p=0.013). Combined motor, cognitive, and attention impairment negatively affected QoL (p=0.001).

The objective of this study was to investigate the relationship between early-life atopy and vulnerability to mental health problems among youth in the community. METHOD: Data were drawn from the Raine Study (N = 2868), a population-based birth cohort study in Western Australia. Logistic regression and generalized estimating equations were used to examine the relationship between atopy at ages 1-5 years [using parent report and objective biological confirmation (sera IgE)], and the range of internalizing and externalizing mental health problems at ages 5-17 years. RESULTS: Atopy appears to be associated with increased vulnerability to affective and anxiety problems, compared to youth without atopy. These associations remained significant after adjusting for a range of potential confounders. No relationship was evident between atopy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or externalizing problems. CONCLUSIONS: Findings are the first linking atopy (measured by both parent report and objective verification) with increased vulnerability to affective and anxiety problems. Therefore, replication is required. If replicated, future research aimed at understanding the possible biological and/or social and environmental pathways underlying these links is needed. Such information could shed light on shared pathways that could lead to more effective treatments for both atopy and internalizing mental health problems.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.06

High-intensity and sustained delivery of quality EIBI is expensive. The TOBY (Therapy Outcomes by You) Playpad is an App-based platform delivering EIBI to facilitate learning for young children with ASD, while enabling parents to become co-therapists. Intervention targets include increasing joint attention, imitation and communication of children with ASD. The primary aim of the study presented in this protocol is to determine the effectiveness of the TOBY App in reducing ASD symptoms when used as a complement to conventional EIBI. The secondary aim is to examine parental attributes as a result of TOBY App use. METHODS AND DESIGN: Children aged less than 4;3 years diagnosed with ASD and parents will be recruited into this single-blind, randomised controlled trial using a pragmatic approach. Eligible participants will be randomised to the treatment group 'TOBY therapy + therapy as usual' or, the control group 'therapy as usual' for six months. The treatment will be provided by the TOBY App and parent where a combination of learning environments such as on-iPad child only (solo), partner (with parent) and off-iPad - Natural Environment (with parent) Tasks will be implemented. Parents in the treatment group will participate in a TOBY training workshop. Treatment fidelity will be monitored via an App-based reporting system and parent diaries. The primary outcome measure is the Autism Treatment Evaluation Checklist. The secondary outcome measures involve diagnostics, functional and developmental assessments, including parent questionnaires at baseline (T0), three months (T1) and six months (T2). DISCUSSION: This trial will determine the effectiveness of the TOBY App as a therapeutic complement to other early interventions children with ASD receive. The trial will also determine the feasibility of a parent delivered early intervention using the iPad as an educational platform, and assess the impact of the TOBY App on parents' self-efficacy and empowerment in an effort to reduce children's ASD symptoms. The outcomes of this trial may have EIBI services implications for newly diagnosed children with ASD and parents.

METHOD: Within the EArly Genetics and Lifecourse Epidemiology (EAGLE) consortium, genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and ADHD symptom scores were available for 17,666 children (<13 years of age) from nine population-based cohorts. SNP-based heritability was estimated in data from the three largest cohorts. Meta-analysis based on genome-wide association (GWA) analyses with SNPs was followed by gene-based association tests, and the overlap in results with a meta-analysis in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) case-control ADHD study was investigated. RESULTS: SNP-based heritability ranged from 5% to 34%, indicating that variation in common genetic variants influences ADHD symptom scores. The meta-analysis did not detect genome-wide significant SNPs, but three genes, lying close to each other with SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium (LD), showed a gene-wide significant association (p values between 1.46 x 10(-6) and 2.66 x 10(-6)). One gene, WASL, is involved in neuronal development. Both SNP- and gene-based analyses indicated overlap with the PGC meta-analysis results with the genetic correlation estimated at 0.96. CONCLUSION: The SNP-based heritability for ADHD symptom scores indicates a polygenic architecture, and genes involved in neurite outgrowth are possibly involved. Continuous and dichotomous measures of ADHD appear to assess a genetically common phenotype. A next step is to combine data from population-based and case-control cohorts in genetic association studies to increase sample size and to improve statistical power for identifying genetic variants.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","Dr. Hudziak has received grant or research support from the National Institutes of Health, the National Institute of Mental Health, the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease, and the state of Vermont.

Those affected generally have severe functional impairments, and medical comorbidities such as scoliosis and poor growth are common. There is a paucity of information on the natural history of many rare disorders and an even greater deficit of evidence to guide best practice. The population-based and longitudinal Australian Rett Syndrome Database established in 1993 has supported investigations of the natural history of Rett syndrome and effectiveness of treatments. This paper reviews the disorder Rett syndrome and evidence for the management of scoliosis and poor growth within a clinical ethics framework. Compared with conservative management, we have shown that spinal fusion is associated with reduced mortality and better respiratory health. We have also shown that gastrostomy insertion is associated with subsequent weight gain. Family counselling for both procedures necessarily must include family perspectives and careful clinical attention to their needs and wishes. Vignettes describing family decision-making and experiences are presented to illustrate the principals of beneficence and autonomy in determining the best interests of the child and family. A blend of evidence-based practice with a strong clinical ethics framework has capacity to build existing strengths in families and reduce the negative impacts of disability and in so doing, optimise the health and wellbeing of those with Rett syndrome.",Journal Article,The authors declare that they had no interests that might be perceived as posing a conflict or bias.,0.04

To identify factors associated with stimulant and antidepressant use by children and adolescents in Australia. METHODS: Data are from a nationally representative sample of 4- to 17-year-olds (n = 6310). Parents completed the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children-Version IV (DISC-IV) and the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire. Eleven- to 17-year-olds completed a self-report version of the DISC-IV MDD module. Interviewers recorded prescribed medications used by participants in the previous 2 weeks. RESULTS: During a 2-week period, 1.3% of all 4- to 17-year-olds and 13.7% of those with symptoms meeting the criteria for ADHD had used stimulant medication, while 0.9% of all 4- to 17-year-olds and 13.4% with MDD had used antidepressants. In total, 22.6% of those using stimulant medications and 57.7% using antidepressant medications did not have symptoms meeting criteria for ADHD or MDD, respectively. Among 11- to 17-year-olds, 5.6% of those with adolescent-only-reported MDD, 10.9% of those with parent/carer-only-reported MDD, and 25.7% of those with MDD reported by both parents/carers and adolescents were using antidepressant medications. CONCLUSIONS: Only a minority of 4- to 17-year-olds with ADHD and MDD were being treated with stimulant or antidepressant medication. The percentage of adolescents with MDD using antidepressant medications varied depending on whether adolescents, parents/carers, or both identified the presence of MDD.

METHODS: DESIGN: cross-sectional, multi-site practice audit with questionnaires completed by paediatricians and parents at the point of ADHD diagnosis. SETTING: private/public paediatric practices in Western Australia and Victoria, Australia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: paediatricians: elements of assessment and management were indicated on a study-designed data form. Parents: ADHD symptoms and comorbidities were measured using the Conners 3 ADHD Index and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire, respectively. Sleep problems, previous assessments and interventions, and agreement with ADHD diagnosis were measured by questionnaire. RESULTS: Twenty-four paediatricians participated, providing data on 137 patients (77% men, mean age 8.1 years). Parent and teacher questionnaires were used in 88% and 85% of assessments, respectively. Medication was prescribed in 75% of cases. Comorbidities were commonly diagnosed (70%); however, the proportion of patients identified by paediatricians with internalising problems (18%), externalising problems (15%) and sleep problems (4%) was less than by parent report (51%, 66% and 39%). One in seven parents did not agree with the diagnosis of ADHD.

METHODS: Data were obtained from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort Study (Raine) with neuropsychological tests at age 10 years measuring language, cognition, motor function, and behavior. Latent class analysis of the tests was used to divide the cohort into mutually exclusive subclasses of neurodevelopmental deficit. Multivariable polytomous logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between exposure to surgery and anesthesia and each latent class, adjusting for demographic and medical covariates. RESULTS: In our cohort of 1444 children, latent class analysis identified 4 subclasses: (1) Normal: few deficits (n=1135, 78.6%); (2) Language and Cognitive deficits: primarily language, cognitive, and motor deficits (n=96, 6.6%); (3) Behavioral deficits: primarily behavioral deficits, (n=151, 10.5%); and (4) Severe deficits: deficits in all neuropsychological domains (n=62, 4.3%). Language and cognitive deficit group children were more likely to have exposure before age 3 (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.17-3.81), whereas a difference in exposure was not found between Behavioral or Severe deficit children (aOR, 1.00; 95% CI, 0.58-1.73, and aOR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.34-2.15, respectively) and Normal children. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that in evaluating children exposed to surgery and anesthesia at an early age, the phenotype of interest may be children with deficits primarily in language and cognition, and not children with broad neurodevelopmental delay or primarily behavioral deficits.",Journal Article,,0.15

This study aimed to examine whether different components of WM can be improved following adaptive WM training (Cogmed) and whether improvements in WM generalize to other cognitive (attention) and academic skills (reading and mathematics) in children with TBI. Twenty-seven children with moderate to severe TBI were randomized to adaptive (Cogmed; n = 13) or non-adaptive training (active placebo; n = 14) and evaluated at baseline, post-training, and 3-months follow-up. Three children in the adaptive group and one child in the non-adaptive group withdrew from the study before completion of training. Complete case (CC) and intention-to-treat (ITT) analyses were conducted. Children in the adaptive group demonstrated significantly greater gains on select WM tasks (VSSP, but not PL or CE) from pre- to post-training (pre-post) and pre-training to follow-up (pre-follow-up; CC and ITT analyses). No gains were found on tests of attention. Adaptive training resulted in significantly greater gains on select academic skills (reading, but not mathematics): reading comprehension pre-post-training (ITT analyses) and reading accuracy pre-follow-up (CC and ITT analyses). This first, to our knowledge, study to examine the efficacy of adaptive WM training for children with TBI provides preliminary evidence of near and far transfer of training to WM and academic skills, respectively.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Randomized Controlled Trial, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.06

Recent studies have suggested ongoing neurological deficits and neurocognitive impairment in these patients. Little information on the correlation of clinical and neuroimaging markers in ADEM is available. We examined potential clinical factors (e.g., age of onset, acute symptom duration, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] lesions) and their relation to neurocognitive and psychosocial outcomes. METHODS: This is a retrospective chart review of consecutive pediatric patients diagnosed with ADEM between 2006 and 2012. Patients were evaluated with standard neurological assessment, MRI of the brain, and neuropsychological evaluation. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients with ADEM with average age at neuropsychological assessment of 10.1 years (+/-3.50) were included. Five (22.7%) patients were impaired on three or more neurocognitive measures. Psychosocial problems were reported in 20%-40% of patients. Earlier age of onset was correlated with poorer sustained attention and psychosocial problems, whereas acute symptom duration and Expanded Disability Status Scale were not. MRI outcomes were correlated with psychosocial outcomes but not neuropsychological findings. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest lingering cognitive and psychosocial deficits in children with a history of ADEM. Clinical features and MRI findings correlated more strongly with psychosocial outcomes than cognitive functioning. Further studies are needed to confirm relationships and other possible contributing factors to lingering deficits.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

METHOD: Seven mental disorders were assessed using the parent- or carer-completed version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV, and major depressive disorder was also assessed using the youth self-report version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV. Severity and impact were assessed using an extended version of the Diagnostic Interview Schedule for Children Version IV impact on functioning questions, and days absent from school due to symptoms of mental disorders. Data were collected in a national face-to-face survey of 6310 parents or carers of children and adolescents aged 4-17 years, with 2969 young people aged 11-17 years also completing a self-report questionnaire. RESULTS: Twelve-month prevalence of mental disorders was 13.9%, with 2.1% of children and adolescents having severe disorders, 3.5% having moderate disorders and 8.3% having mild disorders. The most common class of disorders was attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder followed by anxiety disorders. Mental disorders were more common in step-, blended- or one-parent families, in families living in rented accommodation and families where one or both carers were not in employment. Mental disorders were associated with a substantial number of days absent from school particularly in adolescents. CONCLUSION: Mental disorders are common in children and adolescents, often have significant impact and are associated with substantial absences from school. Child and adolescent mental disorders remain an important public health problem in Australia. Accurate information about prevalence and severity of child and adolescent mental disorders is an essential prerequisite for effective mental health policy and service planning.",Journal Article,,0.06

The few patients with cognitive impairment admitted to rehabilitation generally receive services based on outdated impairment-reduction models, rather than recommended function-based approaches. Both reduced access to rehabilitation and the knowledge-to-practice gap stem from a reported lack of skills and knowledge regarding cognitive rehabilitation on the part of inpatient rehabilitation team members. To address these issues, a multi-faceted knowledge translation (KT) initiative will be implemented and evaluated. It will be targeted specifically at the inter-professional application of the cognitive orientation to daily occupational performance (CO-OP). CO-OP training combined with KT support is called CO-OP KT. The long-term objective of CO-OP KT is to optimize functional outcomes for individuals with stroke and cognitive impairments. Three research questions are posed: 1. Is the implementation of CO-OP KT associated with a change in the proportion of patients with cognitive impairment following a stroke accepted to inpatient rehabilitation? 2. Is the implementation of CO-OP KT associated with a change in rehabilitation clinicians' practice, knowledge, and self-efficacy related to implementing the CO-OP approach, immediately following and 1 year later? 3. Is CO-OP KT associated with changes in activity, participation, and self-efficacy to perform daily activities in patients with cognitive impairment following stroke at discharge from inpatient rehabilitation and at 1-, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups? METHODS/DESIGN: Three interrelated studies will be conducted. Study 1 will be a quasi-experimental, interrupted time series design measuring monthly summaries of stroke unit level data. Study 2, which relates to changes in health care professional practice and self-efficacy, will be a single group pre-post evaluation design incorporating chart audits and a self-report survey. Study 3 will assess patient functional outcomes using a non-randomized design with historical controls. Assessments will occur during admission and discharge from rehabilitation and at 1, 3, and 6 months following discharge from rehabilitation.

Obesity has been associated with psychological disorders, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, whose prevalence has been estimated at 6.8 % in Spanish children and adolescents. It is known that physical activity is positively related to academic achievement and negatively related to the risk of obesity in children. However, studies to test the effectiveness of physical activity interventions in improving academic achievement in preschool children are scarce and have some weaknesses that threaten their validity. Moreover, very few studies have examined their effectiveness in improving symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. This paper outlines a two-year multidimensional preschool intervention (Movi-Kids) aimed at preventing obesity and improving academic achievement in children with or without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. METHODS/DESIGN: Twenty-one schools from Ciudad Real and Cuenca, Spain, were randomized to intervention and control groups. In the first academic year, children in the third grade of preschool and the first grade of primary school in the intervention group received the Movi-Kids intervention. In the second academic year, schools were crossed over to the other group. The intervention included children, parents and teachers, and the school environment, and consisted of: (i) three hour-long sessions of recreational non-competitive physical activity after school, weekly, (ii) educational materials for parents and teachers addressing sedentary lifestyle risks and (iii) playground modifications to promote physical activity during breaks. Primary outcome measures of this study were academic achievement (intelligence, cognition, memory, attention and perception), assessed by the Battery of General and Differential Aptitudes, and adiposity measures (body mass index, waist circumference, triceps skinfold thickness and body fat percentage). Secondary outcome measures were: attention deficit hyperactivity disorder risk, motor skills, health-related quality of life and sleep quality. These variables will all be measured in both groups at baseline and at the end of the first and second academic years. DISCUSSION: It seems reasonable that an intervention to promote physical activity based on playground games will be useful for simultaneously improving academic achievement and controlling obesity.

The role of cognitive interventions in post-ABI attention rehabilitation remains unclear. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate effectiveness of cognitive interventions in treating attention deficits following ABI and to explore differences in treatment effect between ABI etiologies. METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and CENTRAL databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Studies were selected by three reviewers. Study quality was assessed using Cochrane Collaboration tool for RCTs. Effect sizes (Hedge's g) for each attentional domain were meta-analyzed with subgroup analysis by ABI etiology. RESULTS: Twelve RCTs with 584 participants were included, representing individuals with stroke, traumatic brain injury (TBI) and CNS-impacting malignancy. Cognitive rehabilitation improved divided attention in stroke survivors (g 0.67; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.98; p < 0.0001) but not other ABI populations. Sustained, selective and alternating attention, and inhibition were not significantly improved in any ABI population. Follow-up data showed no evidence of long-term benefit. CONCLUSION: Cognitive rehabilitation resulted in short-term improvements in divided attention following stroke, but not after TBI or CNS-impacting malignancy. Cognitive interventions did not significantly improve other attentional domains in participants with stroke, TBI or CNS-impacting malignancy.","Journal Article, Meta-Analysis, Review, Systematic Review",,0.32

Psychiatry,"Silva D, Colvin L, Glauert R, Bower C",,"BACKGROUND: Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the most frequent neurodevelopmental disorder in children and is sometimes noted retrospectively in young people and adults who are incarcerated. We aimed to investigate juvenile justice encounters in children with and without ADHD. METHODS: Between January, 1995, and December, 2010, we did a population-based cohort study in Western Australia. Anonymised linked population data were obtained from the Western Australia Midwives Notification System. 12 831 non-Indigenous Australian children and young people aged 10-21 years, who were diagnosed and treated with stimulant drugs for ADHD and had a record in the Monitoring Drugs of Dependence System (ADHD cohort), were identified and frequency-matched by age, sex, and socioeconomic status to 29 722 non-Indigenous Australian children and young people who had no record in the Monitoring Drugs of Dependence System (controls). Community correction records and incarceration records were retrieved for all participants from Total Offending Management Solutions. Our primary outcome was to compare justice outcomes between children with ADHD and those without this disorder. We compared cohorts by conditional logistic regression analysis. FINDINGS: 9939 boys and 2892 girls were diagnosed and treated for ADHD; 22 875 boys and 6847 girls were frequency-matched controls. 792 (8%) boys and 75 (3%) girls with ADHD had a community correction record, compared with 822 (4%) boys and 75 (1%) girls without ADHD. 132 (1%) boys and 11 (<1%) girls with ADHD had an incarceration record, compared with 108 (<1%) boys and five (<1%) girls without ADHD. Compared with controls, boys with ADHD were two and half times more likely to have a community correction record (odds ratio 2.48, 95% CI 2.22-2.76) or an incarceration record (2.63, 2.01-3.44). Compared with their non-ADHD counterparts, girls with ADHD were nearly three times more likely to have a community correction record (odds ratio 2.86, 95% CI 2.03-4.03) and seven times more likely to have an incarceration record (7.27, 2.29-23.08). Boys with ADHD received their first community correction record at a younger age compared with controls (15.9 vs 16.3 years; p=0.0005), but age at first community correction record was similar for girls (16.5 vs 16.4 years; p=0.87). Burglaries and breaking and entering were the most common reason for a first justice record (total 659 [37%]), and this offence was twice as likely in children with ADHD (for boys, odds ratio 2.24, 95% CI 1.90-2.64; for girls, 2.19, 1.40-3.42). INTERPRETATION: Justice outcomes for boys and girls were more frequent among children and young people treated for ADHD compared with their non-ADHD counterparts. Unlike girls, boys were more likely to offend at a younger age. Early diagnosis and management of children and young people with ADHD might reduce the over-representation of children with this disorder within the juvenile justice system.

Both insomnia groups demonstrated night-time rumination, aggressive suppression as a thought control strategy, and exaggerated views regarding the health consequences of poor sleep. In addition, the psychiatric group with insomnia frequently reported the causes of insomnia to be related to their illness (rather than to their lifestyle factors) and had an incomplete understanding of good sleep habits.

The aim of this study was to derive and validate a clinical case definition rule to identify neuropsychological impairment in children and adolescents. An existing normative pediatric sample was used to calculate base rates of abnormal functioning on eight measures covering six domains of neuropsychological functioning. The dataset was analyzed by varying the range of cutoff levels [1, 1.5, and 2 standard deviations (SDs) below the mean] and number of indicators of impairment. The derived rule was evaluated by bootstrap, internal and external clinical validation (orthopedic and traumatic brain injury). Our neuropsychological impairment (NPI) rule was defined as ""two or more test scores that fall 1.5 SDs below the mean."" The rule identifies 5.1% of the total sample as impaired in the assessment battery and consistently targets between 3 and 7% of the population as impaired even when age, domains, and number of tests are varied. The NPI rate increases in groups known to exhibit cognitive deficits. The NPI rule provides a psychometrically derived method for interpreting performance across multiple tests and may be used in children 6-18 years. The rule may be useful to clinicians and scientists who wish to establish whether specific individuals or clinical populations present within expected norms versus impaired function across a battery of neuropsychological tests.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Related measurements collected before and after birth, and during childhood and adolescence can provide a life-course analysis of important factors that contribute to health and behaviour in young adulthood. The Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study has collected a large number of such measurements during the fetal, perinatal, infancy, childhood and adolescence periods and plans to relate them to common health issues and behaviours in young adults, including spinal pain, asthma, sleep disorders, physical activity and sedentary behaviour and, work absenteeism and presenteeism. The aim of this paper is to describe the rationale, design and methods of the 22 year follow-up of the Raine Study cohort. METHODS/DESIGN: The Raine Study is a prospective cohort study. Participants still active in the cohort (n = 2,086) were contacted around the time of their 22nd birthday and invited to participate in the 22 year follow-up. Each was asked to complete a questionnaire, attend a research facility for physical assessment and an overnight sleep study, wear activity monitors for a week, and to maintain a sleep and activity diary over this week. The questionnaire was broad and included questions related to sociodemographics, medical history, quality of life, psychological factors, lifestyle factors, spinal pain, respiratory, sleep, activity and work factors. Physical assessments included anthropometry, blood pressure, back muscle endurance, tissue sensitivity, lung function, airway reactivity, allergic status, 3D facial photographs, cognitive function, and overnight polysomnography. DISCUSSION: Describing the prevalence of these health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will enable better recognition of the issues and planning of health care resources. Providing a detailed description of the phenotype of these issues will provide valuable information to help educate health professionals of the needs of young adults. Understanding the life-course risk factors of health issues and behaviours in young adulthood will have important health planning implications, supporting the development of targeted interventions to improve current health status and reduce the onset and development of further ill-health across adulthood.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

Studies examining longitudinal predictors of poor functioning have tended to be small and report only medium-term follow-up data. We sought to examine clinical predictors of functional outcome in a long-term longitudinal study. METHOD: Participants were 268 (152 females, 116 males) individuals identified as UHR 2-14 years previously. A range of clinical and sociodemographic variables were assessed at baseline. Functioning at follow-up was assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Assessment Scale (SOFAS). RESULTS: Baseline negative symptoms, impaired emotional functioning, disorders of thought content, low functioning, past substance use disorder and history of childhood maltreatment predicted poor functioning at follow-up in univariate analyses. Only childhood maltreatment remained significant in the multivariate analysis (p < 0.001). Transition to psychosis was also significantly associated with poor functioning at long-term follow-up [mean SOFAS score 59.12 (s.d. = 18.54) in the transitioned group compared to 70.89 (s.d. = 14.00) in the non-transitioned group, p < 0.001]. Childhood maltreatment was a significant predictor of poor functioning in both the transitioned and non-transitioned groups. CONCLUSIONS: Childhood maltreatment and transition to psychotic disorder independently predicted poor long-term functioning. This suggests that it is important to assess history of childhood maltreatment in clinical management of UHR individuals. The finding that transition to psychosis predicts poor long-term functioning strengthens the evidence that the UHR criteria detect a subgroup at risk for schizophrenia.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

The main aim of the research that focus on the risks at the beginning, and the future mother infant interactions are factors that have influence on the quality of the early mother-child relationship, and the exploration of the jeopardy and vulnerability of the early relationship disorders. METHODS: I examined fifty mothers who have their first child. I researched the motherly, child- and interactional factors in the days right after the birth and then when the kids were one month old, and again at the age of four and a half month. I assessed the parental stress by the longer version of the PSI (Parenting Stress Index), and the mother anxiety with the help of the STAI-Y (State and feature anxiety value Index), and the features of the depression were tested by the EPDS scale, the Edinburgh Post-natal Depression Scale. PBQ, the Postpartum Bonding Questionnare--reveals the quality of the motherly emotions and behaviour focusing on the kid. The observation of interactions when the child was four and a half month old happened while a 'face-to-face' free play, and the analyses of that were assessed by an own code system. RESULTS: We found correlations between input risk factors and features of motherly interactional styles. The indexes of the after birth depression (depression right after the birth), and the anxiety also showed correlation to the indexes of the attachment of the mother to her child and the parental stress. The correlations among the playfulness, the risk kotodefactors and the quality of the interactions are obvious, that we found. The interactional style of the mother and the interactional strategies of the baby showed correlated patterns too as we examined those. CONCLUSIONS/IMPLICATIONS: We found that pre-history of pregnancy and perinatal events have predictive value on the relationship of the four and a half month old baby and his/her mother. These can add important facts to the prevention and early-prevention of the early mother-child interactions, and other factors in cognition of the potential strengths and weaknesses in order to prevent the future negative outputs (attachment, cognitive and social-emotional development, emotional and behavioural disorders).","English Abstract, Journal Article",,0.04

Evidence indicates that only 60-70% of persons with major depressive disorder who tolerate antidepressants respond to first-line drug treatment; the remainder become treatment resistant. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered an effective therapy in persons with treatment-resistant depression. The use of ECT is controversial due to concerns about temporary cognitive impairment in the acute post-treatment period. We will conduct a meta-analysis to examine the effects of ECT on cognition in persons with depression. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis has been registered with PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42014009100). We developed our methods following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement. We are searching MEDLINE, PsychINFO, EMBASE, CINAHL and Cochrane from the date of database inception to the end of October 2014. We are also searching the reference lists of published reviews and evidence reports for additional citations. Comparative studies (randomised controlled trials, cohort and case-control) published in English will be included in the meta-analysis. Three clinical neuropsychologists will group the cognitive tests in each included article into a set of mutually exclusive cognitive subdomains. The risk of bias of randomised controlled trials will be assessed using the Jadad scale. We will supplement the Jadad scale with additional questions based on the Cochrane risk of bias tool. The risk of bias of cohort and case-control studies will be assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. We will employ the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) to assess the strength of evidence.

In this paper, we summarize our methodology for a population-based, propensity-matched study to evaluate possible anesthesia-related sequelae in preschool children when evaluated in elementary or high school. A cohort of all children born in Olmsted County, Minnesota between the years 1994 and 2007 who are currently local residents has been identified. Existing medical records are being used to identify all episodes of exposure to general anesthesia prior to the age of 3 years (i.e., prior to their 3rd birthday). Children with multiple, single, and no anesthesia exposure are sampled for testing between the ages of 8 and 12 years or 15 and 19 years during the period 2012-2016. To match children in different exposure groups as closely as possible, sampling is guided by propensity-matching for the likelihood of receiving anesthesia. Selected children are invited to participate in a single 4-hour session of neuropsychological testing, including the National Center for Toxicological Research-Operant Test Battery, which has been used to study anesthetic neurotoxicity in nonhuman primates. The results of this testing will be compared among children with different anesthetic exposure histories. The expected products of this research will be a detailed phenotype of possible anesthetic-associated neurotoxicity in humans, utilizing a robust patient database and neuropsychological testing battery, and the first comparison of effects of anesthetic exposure in children and nonhuman primates performing nearly identical behavioral tasks.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,0.13

In this study, we assess outcomes associated with initial anesthetic exposure occurring between 3 and 10 years of age. METHODS: We used data from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study to examine the risk of cognitive deficit at age 10 in children with initial anesthetic exposure between 3 and 5 years and between 5 and 10 years of age compared with children unexposed at those ages. The cohort included 2868 children born from 1989 to 1992 evaluated using a range of neuropsychological tests. A modified multivariable Poisson regression model was used to determine the adjusted association of initial anesthetic exposure in each age group with outcomes. RESULTS: Exposed and unexposed children were found to have similar neuropsychological test results except for the McCarron Assessment of Neuromuscular Development (MAND) motor function scores. Even after adjusting for demographic and comorbidity differences, children exposed to anesthesia had a higher risk of motor deficit after initial exposure between ages 3 and 5 years (adjusted risk ratio, 2.32; 95% confidence interval, 1.42-3.79) and between 5 and 10 years (adjusted risk ratio, 2.33; 95% confidence interval, 1.21-4.48) compared with unexposed children. CONCLUSIONS: Initial exposure to anesthesia after age 3 had no measurable effects on language or cognitive function. Decreased motor function was found in children initially exposed after age 3 even after accounting for comorbid illness and injury history. These results suggest that there may be distinct windows of vulnerability for different neurodevelopmental domains in children.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",,0.04

Autism Speaks engaged a panel of experts to evaluate the readiness of available measures of social communication for use as outcome measures in clinical trials. The panel held monthly conference calls and two face-to-face meetings over 14 months. Key criteria used to evaluate measures included the relevance to the clinical target, coverage of the symptom domain, and psychometric properties (validity and reliability, as well as evidence of sensitivity to change).

Guidelines for evidence-informed rehabilitation are needed, thus an international group of researchers and clinicians (known as INCOG) convened to develop recommendations for assessment and intervention. METHODS: An expert panel met to select appropriate recommendations for assessment and treatment of cognitive-communication disorders based on available literature. To promote implementation, the team developed decision algorithms incorporating the recommendations, based on inclusion and exclusion criteria of published trials, and then prioritized recommendations for implementation and developed audit criteria to evaluate adherence to best practice recommendations. RESULTS: Rehabilitation of individuals with cognitive-communication disorders should consider premorbid communication status; be individualized to the person's needs, goals, and skills; provide training in use of assistive technology where appropriate; include training of communication partners; and occur in context to minimize the need for generalization. Evidence supports treatment of social communication problems in a group format. CONCLUSION: There is strong evidence for person-centered treatment of cognitive-communication disorders and use of instructional strategies such as errorless learning, metacognitive strategy training, and group treatment.

Records of all non-Aboriginal children under 18 years who met the DSMIV/ICD10 criteria for ADHD and prescribed stimulant medication in Western Australia between 2003 and 2007 (n = 11,902) were linked to two other health data systems-the hospital morbidity data system and the midwives notification system (MNS). The non-ADHD reference population (n = 27,304) was randomly selected from the MNS. Compared with controls, children under 4 years who subsequently were diagnosed and treated for ADHD were 70% [odds ratio (OR) 1.70; 95% confidence intervals (CI) 1.62-1.77] more likely to be admitted to hospital under 4 years of age. There was an increased risk for injury or poison (OR 1.73; 95% CI 1.59-1.88), respiratory disease (OR 1.49; 95% CI 1.40-1.59), ear disease (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.86-2.21), infectious diseases (OR 1.68; 95% CI 1.53-1.85) and neurological conditions (OR 2.03; 95% CI 1.68-2.44). Admissions under 4 years of age for head injuries, burns, poisons, all other injuries, diseases of the tonsils and adenoids, asthma and early infections were all more common amongst children subsequently diagnosed with and treated for ADHD. There is significant early hospital morbidity for children subsequently diagnosed with ADHD. Multiple aetiologies and causal pathways need to be considered where some of these may include early infections, inflammatory conditions, epilepsy and injuries. Future studies should look at which of these conditions may be on the causal pathway or likely early markers for ADHD.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.53

However, no studies have specifically examined whether fish oil supplementation can reduce the frequency and severity of impulsive aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders. METHODS: Children presenting with impulsive aggression and meeting research criteria for diagnosis of disruptive behavior disorders were randomized to receive either: 1) Fish oil capsules (4 g daily) for 6 weeks followed by placebo (identical-looking capsules) for 6 weeks; or 2) placebo for 6 weeks, followed by fish oil for 6 weeks, in a double-blind, crossover design. Primary outcomes were the Children's Aggression Scale and the Modified Overt Aggression Scale. Secondary outcomes included emotional and behavioral functioning (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire [SDQ]), hyperactivity symptoms (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder [ADHD] Rating Scale), family functioning (Family Assessment Device), and cognitive functioning (Stop Signal Task, Trail-Making Task, and Eriksen Flanker Task). Serum concentrations of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids were measured at baseline, and at 6 and 12 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-one children participated (81% male; mean age 10.3+/-2.2 years; range 7-14). Fish oil treatment increased serum concentrations of eicosapentanoic acid (F=14.76, p<0.05) and total omega-3s (F=20.56, p<0.05), but did not influence primary ratings of aggression. In fact, a trend suggested that fish oil worsened a secondary measure of aggression (SDQ Conduct Subscale, F=4.34, p=0.06). Fish oil treatment was associated with an improvement in one rating of hyperactivity (SDQ Hyperactivity Subscale, F=2.22, p<0.05), but did not influence any other outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that fish oil treatment does not improve aggression in children with disruptive behavior disorders.","Journal Article, Randomized Controlled Trial",,0.28

Our findings are based on exploratory studies of predominantly male football players at the high school, collegiate, and professional levels. Most athletes recover within days to a few weeks, and American and Australian professional football players return to play quickly after mild traumatic brain injury. Delayed recovery appears more likely in high school athletes, in those with a history of previous concussion, and in those with a higher number and duration of postconcussion symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: The evidence concerning sports concussion course and prognosis is very preliminary, and there is no evidence on the effect of return-to-play guidelines on prognosis.

Concerns have mounted, based on both laboratory studies including various mammalian species and retrospective human clinical studies, that the very drugs that induce sedation and anesthesia may trigger an injury in the developing brain, resulting in long-lasting neurobehavioral consequences. RECENT FINDINGS: New retrospective studies further augment these concerns. Specifically, recent studies support that a single anesthesia exposure before age 3 may increase the risk for long-term disabilities in language acquisition and abstract reasoning, and that exposure to two or more anesthetics before age 2 nearly doubles the risk for an attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder diagnosis by age 19. However, methodological limitations preclude final conclusions or change in practice based on these reports, as retrospective studies cannot prove causation. Ongoing prospective clinical studies such as 'General Anesthesia and Apoptosis Study', 'Pediatric Anesthesia NeuroDevelopment Assessment', and 'Mayo Safety in Kids' trials will offer more answers in the future. Meanwhile, laboratory experiments continue to describe differential morphologic injury to individual structures in the neuropil, and have identified mitochondrial dysfunction and neuroinflammation as potential links in the injury process. Additionally, concepts for protection against anesthesia-induced neurotoxicity continue to be tested in the laboratory. SUMMARY: Results from ongoing prospective clinical trials and translational research will help clarify whether anesthesia-associated neurotoxicity affects the developing human brain, including whether it causes long-term disability, and may further identify the injury mechanisms and potential strategies for protection. Currently, the available evidence does not support a change in practice.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't, Review",,0.09

Children were randomly assigned to group therapy with or without CAI. Parents of children in both groups simultaneously participated in weekly parent group therapy sessions. RESULTS: Across both treatment groups, parents reported improvements in children's social skills, prosocial behaviors, and problematic behaviors. In both groups, the severity of ADHD symptoms declined during the course of treatment; however, children who received the CAI model exhibited greater reductions in the severity of ADHD symptoms than did children who received cognitive-behavioral therapy without CAI.

Parents in particular express disquiet with services. One response to this tension is a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parental and education perceptions of this process have not been evaluated previously. A community multidisciplinary approach was assessed in terms of diagnostic outcomes and client satisfaction. METHOD: A comprehensive multidisciplinary structured assessment of the first 50 referred children with severe attentional problems was documented. Demographic and symptom/behavioural profiles, developmental history and indicated multi-disciplinary evaluation were recorded. A team consensus process arrived at diagnostic classification. Post-assessment satisfaction of parents and school staff was surveyed. RESULTS: Thirteen children (26%) were diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and three commenced stimulants.

Additionally, we wanted to investigate which sociodemographic, linguistic, and medical factors contributed to the level of behavioral problems, to pinpoint where targeted interventions can take place. This large, retrospective study included a sample of 261 school-aged children (mean age = 11.8 years, SD = 1.6), that consisted of three age- and gender-matched subgroups: 75 with hearing aids, 57 with cochlear implants, and 129 normally hearing controls. Self- and parent-reports concerning reactive and proactive aggression, delinquency, and symptoms of psychopathy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder were used. In addition, several language and intelligence tests were administered. Hearing-impaired children showed significantly more proactive aggression, symptoms of psychopathy, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, and conduct disorder than their normally hearing peers. More behavioral problems were associated with special schools for the deaf, sign (-supported) language, hearing aids (in contrast to cochlear implants), higher age, male gender, lower socioeconomic status, lower intelligence, and delayed language development. Hearing-impaired children face multiple problems regarding their behavior. The outcomes implicate that professionals should be aware of the higher risk of developing behavioral problems, in order to screen, detect, and treat in time.

In this study its effect on copy number variation (CNV), known to cause genetic disorders was explored. As the olfactory receptor (OR) repertoire comprises the largest human gene family, it was selected for this study, which was carried out within and between three populations, derived from 150 individuals from the 1000 Genome Project. Analysis of 3872 CNVs detected among 791 OR loci, in which 307 loci showed CNV, revealed the following novel findings: Sex bias in CNV was significantly more prevalent in uncommon than common CNV variants of OR pseudogenes, in which the male genome showed more CNVs; and in one-copy number loss compared to complete deletion of OR pseudogenes; both findings implying a more recent evolutionary role for gender. Sex bias in copy number gain was also detected. Another novel finding was that the observed sex bias was largely dependent on ethnicity and was in general absent in East Asians. Using a CNV public database for sick children (International Standard Cytogenomic Array Consortium) the application of these findings for improving clinical molecular diagnostics is discussed by showing an example of sex bias in CNV among kids with autism. Additional clinical relevance is discussed, as the most polymorphic CNV-enriched OR cluster in the human genome, located on chr 15q11.2, is found near the Prader-Willi syndrome/Angelman syndrome bi-directionally imprinted region associated with two well-known mental retardation syndromes. As olfaction represents the primitive cognition in most mammals, arguably in competition with the development of a larger brain, the extensive retention of OR pseudogenes in females of this study, might point to a parent-of-origin indirect regulatory role for OR pseudogenes in the embryonic development of human brain. Thus any perturbation in the temporal regulation of olfactory system could lead to developmental delay disorders including mental retardation.",Journal Article,,0.02

STUDY DESIGN: In this prospective cohort study, 75 infants were tested at 34 weeks PMA and again at term using the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit Network Neurobehavioral Scale. Infants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at term equivalent. Regression was used to investigate differences in the scale's domains of function across time and in relation to perinatal exposures. RESULTS: At term equivalent, preterm infants exhibited altered behavior compared with full-term infants, with poorer orientation (P < .001), lower tolerance of handling (P < .001), lower self-regulation (P < .001), poorer reflexes (P < .001), more stress (P < .001), hypertonicity (P < .001), hypotonia (P < .001), and more excitability (P = .007). Preterm infants from 34 weeks PMA to term equivalent, demonstrated changes in motor functions with declining quality of movement (P = .006), increasing hypertonia (P < .001), decreasing hypotonia (P = .001), and changes in behavior with increasing arousal (P < .001), increasing excitability (P < .001), and decreasing lethargy (P < .001). Cerebral injury was associated with more excitability (P = .002). However, no associations were detected between any of the perinatal exposures and developmental change from 34 weeks PMA to term equivalent. CONCLUSION: Preterm infants have altered neurobehavior in a broad number of domains at term equivalent. Cerebral injury alters neurobehavior but does not appear to impair early neurobehavioral changes. Important neurobehavioral changes occur before term, and this provides an opportunity for interventions in the neonatal intensive care unit.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

This study examined self-awareness of driving simulator and neuropsychological performance among stroke patients, comparing them with healthy control participants. METHODS: Thirty stroke survivors and 30 controls each were asked for prediction and postdiction ratings of their performance on various driving simulator and neuropsychological tasks. Self-estimates versus actual performance discrepancy scores were calculated for various simulator and neuropsychological measures by converting scores to a shared metric. RESULTS: Across all measures, the stroke survivors greatly overestimated their performance in comparison with the accuracy of self-evaluations among the controls, thus suggesting ISA. This pattern of overestimating was observed on both novel (neuropsychological) and familiar (driving) tasks. However, there was some evidence to suggest that stroke survivors can benefit from feedback, as seen by increased accuracy in postdiction versus prediction self-evaluation scores. Both stroke survivors and controls also showed a greater shift toward accurate self-estimation on postdiction of driving performance than on postdiction of neuropsychological test performance. CONCLUSION: Although the temporal stability of the shift in awareness is not known, these results support the use of driving simulators as a useful and safe method of assessing and potentially improving stroke survivors' ISA.","Journal Article, Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",,0.0

Employed youth from both age groups had their disability a long time while few people who were recently diagnosed were working. Transportation was a significant predictor of employment for both age groups. Young adults (20-24) worked more hours per week, in different industries, and more of them were self-employed compared to the 15-19 year olds. Employment status and work characteristics also differed by type of disability. CONCLUSIONS: Rehabilitation and life skills counsellors need to pay particular attention to youth who may need extra help in gaining employment.",Journal Article,,0.02

Sensation-seeking (assessed over the first 4 assessments) predicted affiliating with deviant peers and level of favorable social images of kids who use marijuana (both assessed over the subsequent 3 assessments). Affiliation with deviant peers and the growth in social images predicted marijuana use in 11th and 12th grades.

A cognitive rehabilitation program was piloted to improve the memory and educational achievement of children with sickle cell disease and stroke. While the intervention was feasible, additional research is needed to establish efficacy. Ongoing studies are designed to improve the cognitive impairment for children with SCD and stroke.

By design, emphasis was on highly individualized plans of care in which traditional office-based services played only a small part. During the first 30 months of KO's operation, 228 children, whose severity of emotional disturbances was comparable to those of children placed in residential treatment centers, had average monthly expenditures for first admissions of 2,734 dollars for services and 228 dollars for administrative fees.

METHOD: Six months after a wildfire disaster, we conducted a school-based program to screen for wildfire-related events, such as exposure to and perception of threat, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and general psychopathology. RESULTS: The screening battery was completed by 222 children (mean age 12.5 years, SD 2.48; range 8 to 18 years). Severe or very severe PTSD was reported by 9.0% of students, while 22.6% scored in the abnormal range on the Emotional Symptoms subscale of the SDQ. Younger children and individuals with greater exposure to and perception of threat experienced higher levels of PTSD and general psychopathology. Female students reported a greater perception of threat but did not report higher levels of PTSD or other symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Screening was well received by students, parents, and staff and proved feasible in the postdisaster environment. The PTSD-RI and SDQ demonstrated different individual risk associations and functioned as complementary measures within the screening battery. The identification of children at greatest risk of mental health morbidity enabled service providers to selectively target limited mental health resources.","Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.19

Evidence needs to be developed to direct policy to eliminate unnecessary injuries in this population. METHODS: A review of children younger than 16 years old admitted to a tertiary pediatric trauma center with ATV-related injuries over 12.5 years was conducted. Data included demographics, mechanisms of injury, use of helmets, and outcomes. RESULTS: Of 92 patients, 79% were male, the mean age was 12.1 years, 16% were under 10 years old, and 10% had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (general population prevalence, 1-4%). Flipping/rolling was the most common mechanism of injury (32%) and was associated with sustaining chest and abdominal injuries (odds ratio, 3.7; 95% confidence interval, 1.1-12.9) and an increased Injury Severity Score (ISS). Only 4 of 20 patients with head/facial injuries were using helmets compared with 37 of 40 (odds ratio of head injury with helmet use, 0.02; 95% confidence interval, 0.004-0.101). Forty-five patients had more than one body system injured. The mean ISS was 7.0 (range, 1-35), and high scores were associated with sustaining head and/or truncal injuries. Fourteen percent of cases had an ISS greater than or equal to 12 and two patients died. The median length of stay was 3 days; 12% were admitted over 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: Children continue to sustain a large proportion of preventable and unnecessary injuries caused by ATVs. Although use of protective devices (i.e., helmets) diminishes the extent of injuries, children's smaller size relative to these large machines may contribute to flipping, rolling, and loss of control. Increased risk-taking by those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may also play a role. Efforts are needed to lobby for policies to limit the promotion and restrict the use of ATVs by children.",Journal Article,,0.19

This study presents several prospective case studies of the initial prodrome to bipolar affective disorder. METHODS: Three patients are presented who developed bipolar disorder during their treatment at the Personal Assessment and Crisis Evaluation Clinic (PACE). They were prospectively interviewed over a 12-month period using standard clinical research interviews. RESULTS: These patients met the criteria for bipolar disorder by the end of the treatment period. Depressive symptoms were the main reason for their first clinical presentation, with mania developing at a later date. Other comorbidities were observed before they were diagnosed with bipolar disorder. LIMITATIONS: The generalisability of our findings was constrained because of the small sample size. Furthermore, our findings are likely to be influenced by the intake criteria used at PACE, a clinic that primarily aims at identifying patients at risk of psychosis rather than bipolar disorder. CONCLUSION: Our study provides information about the initial prodrome to bipolar disorder, which has previously been neglected in research studies. We found there were no prodrome features that clearly distinguished between patients who go on to develop bipolar disorder and those who develop schizophrenia. We hope our prospective data will be the starting point for subsequent studies, with the aim of applying these findings to developing suitable preventative interventions for bipolar disorder.","Case Reports, Journal Article, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.02

Our perspective is based on 16 years of clinical and research experience with young people at this phase of illness as well as the research contributions of many others. We discuss the ethical dilemmas in relation to the three key foci, which make up the early psychosis paradigm. These are the pre-psychotic or prodromal phase, the period of untreated psychosis and the first psychotic episode and the critical period of recovery, which follows this. Most attention is devoted to the pre-psychotic period, however ethical considerations related to research in the other two clinical foci are briefly covered as well. Our contention is that the ethical issues are essentially identical to those arising in early intervention research in mainstream medicine. This has been concealed by inconsistency and emotion, which has great potential to confuse, politicize and derail rational debate. The legacy of the isolation of psychiatry from medicine and consequent prejudice and stigma in the professional as well as the public mind seems to be fueling a tendency in some societies to view psychiatric research as qualitatively different from other medical research. Sound clinical research data should be allowed to illuminate the options for potential consumers across all phases of illness. The alternative is research paralysis, which would force clinical practice to expand blindly without an evidence base.","Journal Article, Review",,0.02

RESULTS: Obese children showed significant decreases (-12.5 +/- 13.5) in percent overweight, internalizing problems (-7.0 +/- 7.3), and total behavior problems (-4.8 +/- 6.6) and increases in behavioral competence (3.7 +/- 5.0) over 2 years of measurement; and their parents showed significant decreases in weight (-5.0 +/- 8.3 kg) and reductions in parental distress (-2.3 +/- 7.6) and in disturbed eating and weight-related cognition (-3.2 +/- 5.3). No significant changes were observed in total KEDS (-0.2 +/- 1.9), weight dissatisfaction (-0.3 +/- 1.7), or purging/restricting (0.2 +/- 0.6) scores.

General knowledge about ADHD (71%) and about LD (74%) was relatively low among both groups. Thirteen percent of all teachers considered LD to be the result of parental attitudes, namely 'spoiling' the children. The score for attitude and understanding of ADHD children was relatively low (72.5%) for both groups, whereas Group B teachers scored higher regarding LD cases. Almost 40% considered that ADHD children should be rebuked and/or punished in a manner similar to non-ADHD kids. Regarding long-term outcome, 45.7% of the teachers expected ADHD children to experience multiple difficulties in family life during adulthood. In relation to LD cases, the overall scoring for positive attitude was 75%. However, this score was higher for Group B teachers. Three-quarters of the teachers favored increasing peer awareness and comprehension as to the problems LD kids encounter at school.

At termination symptoms associated with ADHD were markedly reduced and parent-child relationship problems were no longer evident. It is argued that in a subgroup of children family stress and attachment difficulties may be involved in the development of ADHD. These difficulties should be considered separately in the treatment of children with ADHD, especially if still present after the symptomatic treatment.

Supplementum,Pam A,"Adaptation, Psychological/physiology, Animals, Biological Psychiatry/*methods, Brain/physiopathology, Evaluation Studies as Topic, Humans, Mental Disorders/genetics/physiopathology/psychology, Pedigree, Research Design, Social Environment","Biological psychiatry has four principal modes of investigation but each has been flawed by errors in procedure and inference such that the bulk of existing findings must be called into question. Pedigree studies are ruined by selective adoption, the use of ""throw-away kids"" to demonstrate so-called genetic effects, lack of case history data, and lapses in ""blind"" diagnosis. In particular, the Danish adoption studies are challenged, despite the field's insistence that this research has settled the nature-nurture controversy in schizophrenia. Pharmacological-response studies are the next line of methodology and these are marred by a spurious assumption that drugs which work must be correcting a biochemical imbalance that causes the condition. Thirdly, neuropsychological-neurophysiological studies are ""heuristic"" fishing-expeditions to find a presumed abnormality to account for psychopathology, without doing the prospective longitudinal research necessary to validate such theory. Lastly, biochemical correlates of emotion are treated as if each emotion must have a distinct neuronal substrate rather than possibly representing a general visceral arousal where cognition defines the feeling. All told, biological psychiatry is often more reductionist than acknowledged, does not come up to current scientific standards, and uncritically cites work which is, or should be, discredited. At the heart of the problem is an implicit ideology within biological psychiatry, with insufficient awareness of its social ramifications: ""blaming the victim's body"" protects the status quo by holding protoplasm at fault for maladjustment rather than the person, family, or community.","Journal Article, Review",,0.0

Thirteen SLPs completed an online survey about their practices and needs. Interviews were conducted with five parents of DMLs. Results showed that SLPs have lower self-satisfaction with families of DMLs compared to mainstream families. Parents were highly satisfied with the support they received.

This study aimed to investigate neurocognitive functioning in adolescents and adults with a Fontan circulation and associations with structural brain injury, brain volumetry, and postnatal clinical factors. METHODS: In a binational study, participants with a Fontan circulation without a preexisting major neurological disability were prospectively recruited from the Australia and New Zealand Fontan Registry. Neurocognitive function was assessed by using Cogstate software in 107 participants with a Fontan circulation and compared with control groups with transposition of the great arteries (n=50) and a normal circulation (n=41). Brain MRI with volumetric analysis was performed in the participants with a Fontan circulation and compared with healthy control data from the ABIDE I and II (Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange) and PING (Pediatric Imaging, Neurocognition, and Genetics) data repositories. Clinical data were retrospectively collected. RESULTS: Of the participants with a Fontan circulation who had a neurocognitive assessment, 55% were male and the mean age was 22.6 years (SD 7.8). Participants with a Fontan circulation performed worse in several areas of neurocognitive function compared with those with transposition of the great arteries and healthy controls (P<0.05). Clinical factors associated with worse neurocognitive outcomes included more inpatient days during childhood, younger age at Fontan surgery, and longer time since Fontan procedure (P<0.05). Adults with a Fontan circulation had more marked neurocognitive dysfunction than adolescents with a Fontan circulation in 2 domains (psychomotor function, P=0.01 and working memory, P=0.02). Structural brain injury was present in the entire Fontan cohort; the presence of white matter injury was associated with worse paired associate learning (P<0.001), but neither the presence nor severity of infarct, subcortical gray matter injury, and microhemorrhage was associated with neurocognitive outcomes. Compared with healthy controls, people with a Fontan circulation had smaller global brain volumes (P<0.001 in all regions) and smaller regional brain volumes in most cerebral cortical regions (P<0.05). Smaller global brain volumes were associated with worse neurocognitive functioning in several domains (P<0.05). A significant positive association was also identified between global brain volumes and resting oxygen saturations (P</=0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Neurocognitive impairment is common in adolescents and adults with a Fontan circulation and is associated with smaller gray and white matter brain volume. Understanding modifiable factors that contribute to brain injury to optimize neurocognitive function is paramount.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.0

METHODS: We utilized resting-state, functional MRI data from participants in the Kids-HD study between 6 and 18 years old. Participants were divided into GE (CAG 36-59) and GNE (CAG <36) groups. Seed-to-seed correlations were calculated among 4 regions that provide input signals to the anterior cerebellum: (1) dorsocaudal putamen, (2) globus pallidus externa, (3) subthalamic nucleus, and (4) pontine nuclei; and 2 regions that represented output from the cerebellum: the dentate nucleus to the (1) ventrolateral thalamus and (2) dorsocaudal putamen. Linear mixed effects regression models evaluated differences in developmental trajectories of these connections over time between groups. RESULTS: Four of the six striatal-cerebellum correlations showed significantly different trajectories between groups. All showed a pattern where in the early age ranges (6-12 years) there was hyperconnectivity in the GE compared to the GNE, with those trajectories showing linear decline in the latter half of the age range. CONCLUSION: These results parallel previous findings showing striatal hypertrophy in children with GE as early as age 6. These findings support the notion of developmentally higher connectivity between the striatum and cerebellum early in the life of the child with HD GE, possibly setting the stage for cerebellar compensatory mechanisms.","Journal Article, Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",,0.04

However, studies evaluating decline of this skill in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have produced conflicting results. Irregular word reading was assessed three times over 36 months in a large (N = 995) sample, including healthy control, AD, and Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) groups. At baseline, MCI and AD groups read correctly an average of 3.01 and 7.39 fewer words, respectively, than healthy controls. The MCI group's performance remained stable during the study, but the AD group declined. Importantly, the observed decline was likely an underestimate, as significant numbers of the AD participants (42.6%) could not complete the task at follow-up. Use of alternate (e.g., demographics-based) methods is advised to augment or replace word pronunciation in estimating premorbid intelligence in individuals with even mild AD.

Increasingly, research attention has focused on whether genetic factors conveying susceptibility for these conditions, also influence the risk of other health conditions, such as cancer. We examined the occurrence of hospital admissions and treatment/services for cancer in mothers of children with ASD with or without ID compared with other mothers. After linking Western Australian administrative health databases, we used Cox regression to estimate the hazard ratios (HRs) of any hospitalisations and treatment/services for cancer in these groups of mothers. Mothers of children with ASD without ID had greater risk of admissions for cancer (HR 1.29 [95 % CI 1.1, 1.7]), and for treatment/services in particular (HR 1.41 [95 % CI 1.0, 2.0]), than mothers of children with no ASD/ID, while mothers of children with ASD with ID were no more likely to have a cancer-related hospital admission than other mothers. Mothers of children with autism without ID had increased risk of cancer, which may relate to common genetic pathways.",Journal Article,,0.02

The authors present direct comparison of structural brain circuitry in children and adolescents with NDDs and control subjects and examine brain circuit-behavior relationships across NDDs using dimensional measures related to each disorder. METHOD: Diffusion imaging and behavioral measures were acquired in 200 children and adolescents (ADHD: N=31; OCD: N=36; ASD: N=71; controls: N=62; mean age range: 10.3-12.6 years). Following Tract-Based Spatial Statistics, multigroup comparison of white matter indices was conducted, followed by pairwise comparisons. Relationships of fractional anisotropy with dimensional measures of inattention, social deficits, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, and general adaptive functioning were conducted across the NDD sample. RESULTS: Lower fractional anisotropy within the splenium of the corpus callosum was found in each NDD group, compared with the control group. Lower fractional anisotropy in additional white matter tracts was found in the ASD and ADHD groups, compared with the control group, but not in the OCD group. Fractional anisotropy was lower in the ASD and ADHD groups compared with the OCD group but was not different in ADHD participants compared with ASD participants. A positive relation between fractional anisotropy (across much of the brain) and general adaptive functioning across NDDs was shown. CONCLUSIONS: This study identified disruption in interhemispheric circuitry (i.e., fractional anisotropy alterations in the corpus callosum) as a shared feature of ASD, ADHD, and OCD. However, fractional anisotropy alterations may be more widespread and severe in ASD and ADHD than in OCD. Higher fractional anisotropy throughout the brain appears to be related to better adaptive function across NDDs.",Journal Article,,0.53

It uses the P300 potential in a series of feedback games to improve the subjects' attention. We applied a support vector machine (SVM) using temporal and template-based features to detect these P300 responses. In an experimental setup using five subjects, an average error below 30% was achieved. To make it more challenging the BCI system has been embedded inside an immersive 3D virtual reality (VR) classroom with simulated distractions, which was created by combining a low-cost infrared camera and an ""off-axis perspective projection"" algorithm. This system is intended for kids by operating with four electrodes, as well as a non-intrusive VR setting. With the promising results, and considering the simplicity of the scheme, we hope to encourage future studies to adapt the techniques presented in this study.",Journal Article,,0.49

Eight kids (5.3%) were recognized as highly probability of attention deficit disorder, three (2%) with high probability of subtype hyperactive/impulsive, and one (0.6%) as combined subtype. Children with ADHD might have serious social problems, not only brought by the disorder, but also due to co morbidity with other disorders, leading to serious social withdrawn.

The objective of this study was to determine the agreement between existing diagnostic labels and groups discovered based on a data-driven, diagnosis-agnostic approach integrating cortical neuroanatomy and core-domain phenotype features. A machine learning pipeline, called bagged-multiview clustering, was designed to discover homogeneous subgroups by integrating cortical thickness data and measures of core-domain phenotypic features of ASD, ADHD, and OCD. This study was conducted using data from the Province of Ontario Neurodevelopmental Disorders (POND) Network, a multi-center study in Ontario, Canada. Participants (n = 226) included children between the ages of 6 and 18 with a diagnosis of ASD (n = 112, median [IQR] age = 11.7[4.8], 21% female), ADHD (n = 58, median [IQR] age = 10.2[3.3], 14% female), or OCD (n = 34, median [IQR] age = 12.1[4.2], 38% female), as well as typically developing controls (n = 22, median [IQR] age = 11.0[3.8], 55% female). The diagnosis-agnostic groups were significantly different than each other in phenotypic characteristics (SCQ: chi(2)(9) = 111.21, p < 0.0001; SWAN: chi(2)(9) = 142.44, p < 0.0001) as well as cortical thickness in 75 regions of the brain. The analyses revealed disagreement between existing diagnostic labels and the diagnosis-agnostic homogeneous groups (normalized mutual information < 0.20). Our results did not support the validity of existing diagnostic labels of ASD, ADHD, and OCD as distinct entities with respect to phenotype and cortical morphology.","Journal Article, Multicenter Study, Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",,0.4
